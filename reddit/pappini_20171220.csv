then why were there only two trips to that area to investigate - and neither one took place for over two weeks (December 15 & December 17)?  What kind of investigation is that?

Jackson didn't further explain the statement about SP being ""driven along a winding road.""  The I-5 corridor in that area is all farmland.  That means the roads are all on a grid and are very straight.  There are however a few exceptions of nearby roads following rivers and roads to the west in the mountains.

If SP gave even a vague estimate of drive time the day she was dropped than LE could really narrow down the search.  The winding roads near Yolo are also in very remote areas.  The number of places SP could have been held is limited.  

I don't understand why LE never said specifically said if SP was moved during the 22 days and if she wasn't moved where the suspect she was held.  There could very likely be somebody who lives on a winding road 30 minutes from Yolo who saw activity at formerly occupied house and they didn't call the cops because while unusual it didn't seem suspicious in any way.  However, if they knew that what they saw fit exactly with the context of SP's kidnapping story than maybe they would feel compelled to call LE.

  Narrowing down the search area seems like something LE would have done right away but they didn't.  Bosenko made it even harder to narrow down the search area by not disclosing if SP was moved during the abduction.  A year ago I thought they're not doing this or that because they know what really happened and will be making an arrest soon but after a year with no arrests or even a motive SCSO's failure to disclose relevant information to the public just makes them look incompetent.

To answer your question, if SCSO gets a tip what do they do?  I'd guess they don't do a damn thing.  None of the Papini's seem to care in the slightest how little has been accomplished in this investigation over the last year.  If the victim and her family are this apathetic about finding justice than it shouldn't be a surprise that LE is too."|2||||0||False|0|||False|0|2|What Does SCSO Have To Do With a New Tip?|8|

It's confusing and I don't think locals are taking this seriously. No one is studying Hispanic females, sneaking photos, writing down license plate numbers, and reporting them to the police.

At least as far as we know, right? We have no idea what those tips are. But how far are they going to go to investigate them? What if someone swears they saw those women in Los Angeles and they even provide photos?

Two Latino women in LA who resemble Sherri's kidnappers? Who doesn't resemble those suspects? I think LE knows exactly what happened, but they're stuck. Why tease the public, though, with sketches, once again introducing the possibility that this really did happen and inciting fear of Hispanic women?

It's a very odd conundrum for LE and one that has me stumped.

He started discussions and was 100% certain that his sleuthing had unearthed the AD. He even outed him to some members via private messages.

I would venture to guess the AD is indeed who that person believes him to be, that you're all wrong, and that the AD is someone the media cares enough about to protect.

The AD does seem arrogant and the interview was totally ridiculous and without merit. It accomplished nothing meaningful for him or the Gambles and instead made the whole AD ransom thing seem even more absurd.

So if the AD isn't who you all seem to think he is, but elements of your AD profile are true (local, business man, personally connected to the major players, religious), who else could he be? Who hasn't been considered?

I'll bet he's right in front of you and you're just too blinded by what you think you know to figure it out. What bothers me about the AD is his motivation to broadcast a ransom, his involvement to the point of creating a website that Cameron then took over. There's more personal connection to this than a weak desire to help a beautiful missing mommy.

Have you heard of other ransom scenarios? No? Okay, well, think about that. I think this was a one off. The AD is not in the business of rescuing stolen women, which means this particular situation meant something personal to him. What could it be?

The AD does matter to the case because it's possible the ransom was actually paid, but Cameron in all his professionalism agreed to protect the truth of what went down, possibly in response to a standing threat against Sherri and her family. Which means he lied to law enforcement, or perhaps they know the truth and are part of the secrecy.

Ransom paid or not, though, isn't as interesting as the AD's identity. I'm just wondering why that Reddit guy gave up and backed down."|4||||0||1513623169.0|0|||False|0|4|The AD is Outed As Far As I am concerned. But What Good Has It Done? What Would Be Gained by Outing Michigan Man?|54|

If what LJ said is true that she got the cash in a structured transaction that could have been criminal either by trying to hide under the $10k reporting requirements or by doing sham transactions between the BK Rodriguez businesses and Jeterbuilt for purposes of embezzlement.

I definitely think this is possible.  It's just **too** coincidental that a rich dude just happened to be in town when SP went missing...and he was willing to give big $ for a **ransom**....and an international kidnapping expert (ha) just **happened** to live in the same town and know *exactly* what to do. I suppose the AD has tried this idea in other missing women situations but unfortunately there was no CamGam in town so he had no one to give his $ to.

No offense, but your other posts on this sub make it like you have an axe to grind with CG, for whatever reason. But let’s face it, if he inserted himself into this for self promotion, nothing would be worse for him than not having the $50k if kidnappers actually demanded it. So it would mean he had to have known SP wasn’t really kidnapped. My gut tells me he just really didn’t know where SP was. 

I do agree though that there’s nothing really to gain from exposing MM.  If he’s been investigated and cleared by LE, he probably has nothing to do with her hiatus. If he has a family, why expose his wife and kids?  I think sometimes people forget that there are innocent kids to think about (the Papini kids, gamble kids, etc).

Cameron on the other hand blew off the SCSO.  If anything Cameron may be on the hook for obstruction of justice charges and thus made-up AD is probably regretting his involvement in CH interview.

Having CG involved legitimized kidnapping angle, at least initially.  A hostage negotiator doesn't really have much to do if there isn't a ransom demand so CG decided to just pretend there was a ransom demand.  A fake AD is only a problem when you actually have to pay a ransom.  CG and the P's knew that would never happen.  

The fake AD also solves another problem of how someone in the Papini camp came up with 50-100k in cash.  The P's themselves don't have it so who does.  RR seems like the most likely person to have that kind of cash but he also is tied to enough business dealings and LLC's that he may not want it known that he has 100k in cash available.

Now that begs at which time point Cameron became aware of Sherri's disappearance was just leaving for some fun vs. kidnapped.  For all I know Keith and Cameron may have been convinced that Sherri was kidnapped until she in complete panic contacted Keith via burner phone that she was safe and too embarrassed to come back given the sensationalism with media going nuts.

The younger of the women then escorted Papini out of a room, put her in a vehicle and drove along a winding road, eventually dropping her on the side of the road, Jackson said Papini told investigators.

It was part of the Jackson Revelations.  I think she wove a lot of truths into the stuff that she did remember and it's quite possible.  It depends on how long her drive was that morning.  The cops should have been able to figure it out of she gave an complete and honest account.  She seemed quite alert that morning from he running ability, so I don't see a reason she couldn't have given the cops the duration, auto movements, and speeds for her trip over to I-5.  If it was a 15 minute drive, the number of winding roads is limited and they should know where to look.  If it was a long drive, perhaps that's why the cops were up at Williams as she could have been driven in from the Clear Lake area.  Or she could have been out by Placerville as that's where the AD's phone number now lives."|13||||0||1513525479.0|0|||False|0|13|Winding Road - Please refresh my memory....did the recent release of information from SCSO reveal the winding road on the morning of her release?|14|

So I don't think SP was holed up in a hotel during the day with a pimp meeting seven different dudes, no way, but some of the 'lighter' sex work like mentioned above would make a ton of sense.  She wouldn't tell the police, she would have someone to hide her, she likely would have communicated via burners.  And to be fair it was her team that brought up sex trafficking, and if that was the case, it would have been MUCH MUCH worse for Sherri.  Reading about the rape camps they bring kids to is atrocious.  If that was truly the case I wouldn't expect a statement from her and I'd leave her the heck alone because that's a sick sick business.  I wondered if they floated that idea to cover for her if it was found she was in the trade doing some of the lighter stuff.

Anyway that's why I think it can't be written off as of yet, but I do not mean it to be slander.  I've known a couple people who have done this kind of thing for a couple years and led totally normal lives and are good people.  It really doesn't make someone a bad person.

Papini, her mother alleged, had been harming herself and blaming the injuries on her.

(per)  Shasta County sheriff’s Lt. Pat Kropholler .....several (calls) made to law enforcement by members of Papini’s family between 2000 and 2003. In 2000, her father, Richard Graeff, alleged his daughter burglarized his residence. Three years later, he alleged she made unauthorized withdrawals from his checking account. In 2000, her sister, Sheila Koester, alleged her back door had been kicked in and she believed Papini was the suspect.""

Well, altho never said nor detailed - it is quite reasonable and likely that in the process of the police reviewing these calls and allegations, that an officer almost certainly went & located Sherri and investigated and interviewed her.  Even if they never filed charges, I'd have to suspect that some of what Sherri's mom said was true - (after all, I cannot imagine a mother calling in such a report on her own daughter if it false!) and that the things Sherri was saying WERE LIES!  So if Sherri repeated those claims to the cops, then she IS GUILTY of lying to the police.

So it appears quite likely Sherri already has told lies to the police but the cops chose not to file charges, as the most sensible way to handle the family situation.

Again - this was just more BS and stonewalling by the SCSO- only releasing incomplete tidbits of info and not even saying what all transpired in the past  - possibly covering for SP."|1||||0||False|0|||False|0|1|Implication of giving false testimony to law enforcement in California|25|

It is hard to prove fraud in Go Fund Me campaigns - the rare times it is proven is when someone raises money for a cause or for someone else- then takes the cash & disappears without delivering it to the intended subject.

In the Papini case, the money was clearly raised FOR the Papinis, so if they got it, then it is not fraud, even if the facts of her case were different than conveyed at the time.

Even the Go Fund Me site warns...

""..it’s the user’s responsibility to be discerning when deciding which campaigns are worthy of their hard-earned cash. ...urging its users not to donate to strangers. 
... follow the advice stated on each and every campaign ... Only donate to people you personally know and trust.”

As an example, my wife & I donated once to a ministry that was found to be fraudulently run and the money they were soliciting was being squandered irresponsibly.  We tried to get our donation back but to no avail.  Everywhere we turned the answer was ""buyer beware"" and ""once you voluntarily give it, you're not going to get it back"".

Having said that, I am not justifying what went on...I think there's been a lot of lying and that Sherri knows a whole lot more than she's telling, and that this case will likely never be solved if she isn't going to tell the truth.

One of the most obvious aspects to this case right from the beginning has been how little effort, sentiment or desire has ever been demonstrated by Sherri, Keith, their families or their surrogates - to actually find the ""kidnappers"" and seek justice.

And no need for Sherri to to wear scarlet letter in public.  

We all make mistakes and let's hope that she handles her mistake better by coming out clean with public mea culpa.  That will certainly make their ""brand"" if you can call at that more valuable with book/movie deals and speaking engagements to public and even law enforcement.  

SCSO and prosecutor may not prosecute them but give minor misdemeanors.  Whatever they give back to state of California victim assistance and even GFM account will be made up by other deals they can make with good publicist.

If someone insists that the grass is blue and the sky is green, you can suss out a pretty good picture of the truth.  If someone says the grass was red because it was on fire,  it was red because of blood,  it was red because paint, it could be any one of those things. But it can't be all three. So just because someone isn't outright lying that you can prove doesn't mean they are telling the truth.  

Honestly I believe some of the v exaggerations were because the 20/20 people told KP to ham it up for good TV. Because battered but brave tiny wife and mom sells best.  As for the other inconsistencies, someone is lying.  Maybe many people are.

It was all fine & dandy while Sheri was missing, presumably kidnapped.  Now that she's returned and gone radio silent, people are understandably curious as to what really happened.

Given the crazy inconsistent aspects of their story, it is more than reasonable to assume people in the community would have a balanced share of concern and curiousity if they showed up to eat somewhere nearby.

How can people know for sure they are safe when they are around her?

The cops can’t say there is no danger to the public and still also claim they don’t know what happened.

According to the yet to be changed official narrative, she was kidnapped, tortured, and beaten before being let go. 

If you are concerned about her privacy being breached, think about the other side of the coin too. They could make this all go away with a little honesty, but at this point everyone is beginning to realize she is a liar and a danger to those around her.

Tomorrow it could be you or me or a woman that's been hiding from an abusive stalker and now her location has been outed for anyone to see. 
Did they ""have it coming""?? Perhaps but what about mr dark blue jeans? Did he have it coming as well. 
My point in all this is it's an invasion of someone privacy to secretly snap pics of people and post it without their consent. You don't have to agree w me. You could spend the next 20 years telling me that they had it coming and that's not going to change my opinion. 
Look I wouldn't be here if I didn't think that there was something shady about her story. I don't believe for a second that 2 Latinas randomly kidnapped her, beat her and let her go. there is more to that story and I want the truth just as much as the next person.

Surely both Sherri & Keith know that they are talked about constantly, and that they will be photographed every time they appear in public...
Heck, it's already happened a couple times and they react as if they never dreamed that it might happen.

Now they are doing it again - and even tho what they are doing is perfectly normal, they surely know that just about everyone that will see them, will know who they are and plenty of people will snap pics.

So I can only conclude that they have cleaned up, done their hair and are INTENTIONALLY doing this to provoke the expected response, then they will claim the victim status again and plead with the public to leave them alone.
This is essentially a little trial balloon to see if they get the expected response.  In other words - they are playing us.

I think 100 out of 100 people who might be caught in the same situation of wanting to go out but maybe NOT wanting the gossip and pictures - they would wear sunglasses, cover their head, wear a hoodie, dye their hair, grow a beard/moustache, or just do **ANYTHING** to hide their identity- right?

BUT no, Sherri & Keith look exactly like those photos that were plastered on every telephone pole and all over the internet - so they MUST WANT TO BE SPOTTED AND PHOTOGRAPHED.

I know many people read into the samesiding, but as a long time waitress it's usually the more lovey dovey couples that do this.  My partner is an Italian from NYC and I have gone on a date with another way back before him, who both have mentioned to me that they feel uncomfortable with their back facing the door at dinner.  Some old mob stuff that sounded silly to me.  I do notice KP and SP are sitting together facing the door so maybe they are subtly expressing concern for safety.  That's about all I would gather from this.

I know it does invade their privacy a bit to have pictures taken like this, but at the same time I'm glad it happens to keep pressure on them.  If LE does another info drop like they did before and SP gets caught on camera everywhere she goes, there might be a breaking point where they come clean.

I just cannot understand that.  Many people- her family, friends, LE, others involved have spoken up and said something.  There have even been statements through a spokesperson.  I cannot understand why this woman has not said anything on her own behalf.  It is weird and it makes her look ungrateful and very weak.  It also makes it seem like those around her are enabling.  If I was someone close to SP I would be encouraging her to find some strength and be her own voice.  Her silence is not only weird, it is a large part of what makes everything about this case so suspicious.

I hated that someone stalked them outside their house/the kid's daycare.  This seems a lot less invasive since the photographer just happened to see them at lunch.  I've had friends take similar pictures of me and text it to me saying ""I see you!"" just as a joke before they head over and say Hi. 

 Like it or not, they have made themselves public figures and this is bound to happen, just like it does to *real* famous people. 

I also don't get the criticism of what they are doing. It's a picture taken in a split second, so what if they aren't chatting each other up? Maybe they were making out in the next second (not that making out in public isn't weird...).

It’s clear they aren’t trying to lay low, and it certainly doesn’t look like they are into each other.

If you look closely, you can see the resentment in both their faces.

When they chose to sit down, subliminally or consciously they chose NOT TO FACEBONE ANOTHER.

They can’t even look at one another.

The way I see it, the P's were out and about doing their thing, probably Christmas shopping or something which seems very normal to me, and some person probably purposely snapped this when they had their heads down so the P's did not see their picture being taken.  This is just one single moment, one second of their time, and for all we know they could have been laughing and smiling the rest of their time sitting together.  Maybe they aren't facing each other because there was a tv on the opposite wall and they were watching a sports game, the news or Judge Judy or something.  Or maybe they had other people sitting with them at the table and those people left before the photo was snapped.  I don't know, I just think looking too hard into this photo is kind of pointless because they are just sitting there eating their lunch like everyone else in that room.  I really don't think it's cool at all that people are sneakily snapping pictures of them- that is very invasive and no matter what SP did or did not do, I think some things should be off limits and will give this sub a very bad reputation if this kind of thing is encouraged.  Discussing the case is one thing, but I feel like someone taking this picture is crossing the line.

Edit to add: I think at this point the public has seen so many smiling, staged photos of the P's that any picture of them not smiling or posing seems to paint them in a totally different way than we've come to expect from them.  I think pictures like this seem underwhelming because they are just doing their everyday business.  I'll smile for a camera but if you pull one out and snap it at a random time during my day I likely will look just like one of them in the photo above.  In fact if I'm thinking hard about something my face might even have an angry look to it, which could be completely opposite from what I'm feeling, but it might appear that way just because I am concentrating on whatever I am thinking about."|14||||0||1513089228.0|0|||False|0|14|Papinis eating in Redding today|101|https://i.redditmedia.com/2BRPyfmX5uX0f3msMIgbqwUyoaqfQRVednXTopEhLlQ.jpg?s=2173ae95bf5bc514dc26470f3d44b21b

To be fair, the picture was originally posted in a facebook group and the screenshot was posted here.  

I'm of 2 minds on this issue.  I do not like the idea of photographers stalking the family home. That's creepy.  This picture was taken by a regular person who happened to see them out at lunch, though.  

I think the expectation of privacy is much lower when you are out in public.  People take sneaky pictures of celebrities all the time.  If you go on 20/20 for an hour long interview, you are at least some level of hometown celebrity, so KP kinda made this bed for himself.

It's freaky that people are into that, but whatever floats your boat I guess. I'm sure CamGam is kicking himself for not thinking up that business. The dude who did actually sounds more legit than Cammy: 

""Extreme Kidnapping, in operation since 2002, also designs kidnapping experiences for corporate clients. The company’s owner, Adam Thick, created a “high-impact, high-interaction” mock kidnapping for a nonprofit organization’s senior executives in 2014. About 20 board and staff members searched for the captured director of development during the surprise, team-building mission.

“The clock was ticking and it took everyone’s wit and energy to accomplish the mission,” said Daria S. Torres, managing partner at Wall Torres Group LLC, the strategic consulting firm that arranged the event.

Extreme Kidnapping, identifying a larger market, also offers anti-kidnapping skills training and interrogation courses that teach clients what to do — and what not do — under pressure.

 “Anti-kidnapping is for anyone,” said Thick. “If you travel abroad, if you have kids, if you do business, you need this information.” 

“This is my way of bringing my 15 years of knowledge and experience and transitioning from kidnapping adventures, which is essentially entertainment, to a real-life problem that can give a person the tools to prevent a real kidnapping, or to cope with one,” he told Fox News.""

Example....in CG's AMA, CG mentioned that he 'overheard' one of the SCSO Deputy's wife say that SP had withdrawn $ 1200 cash 2 days before her disappearance.  Thank you Deputy Wife for that information.  If not for CG overhearing that Deputy Wife and telling us about it during the AMA, we (the public) would never have known about that cash withdrawal.  In a disappearance where LE wants to rule out a voluntary departure, looking for a cash withdrawal is one of the FIRST things LE looks for.  LE will also look into whether withdrawing substantial amounts of cash was the norm or if it was highly unusual for the missing person to withdraw so much cash. (I personally have not withdrawn more than $ 200 cash in one transaction over the last 20 years....everything can be paid for with credit cards...I don't care if it's Redding)  Now, we also heard from the CG AMA that most of the $ 1200 cash was still in the P's house (some was used to pay Day Care) but this information is also 'word of mouth' and something that CG was told by one of the PI's that KP hired.   My point u/curiouscuriousone is that it seems that the one's that are not LE or SCSO but that are close to them are the 'regular folks in Redding' that know what really happened.

-May of 2017, 20 year old **Alycia Yeoman** disappeared.  Her car was found in a remote area, her cell phone a short distance away, then later her body was found a half mile away downstream in a river. Cause of death named as ""drowning"" but uncertain if under suspicious circumstances or suicide. - http://ktla.com/2017/05/09/body-of-missing-norcal-college-student-found-in-river-authorities-say/

-in December 2016, only a couple weeks after Sherri Papini went missing, **Jessica Roggenkamp** disappeared about 12 miles south of Redding on I-5.
Similarly, her car was located in a remote wooded area, abandoned with keys & sleeping bag in it. She still has never been found.- http://www.redding.com/story/news/local/anderson/2016/12/12/anderson-woman-44-reported-missing-non-profit-says/95360806/  

-October of 2016, just a month before the Papini case, a blond woman from rural Lewiston CA (only 30 mi west of Redding), **Stacey Smart** leaves home and has never been heard from since. She did not own a car nor have a drivers license so she must have left with someone. - http://www.redding.com/story/news/local/anderson/2016/12/12/anderson-woman-44-reported-missing-non-profit-says/95360806/

Her lifestyle is not consistent and stable, and she hasn’t been able to develop sound relationships with others due to her constant ‘victim’ status. She latched on and may have been caught up.

She very likely did see SP on the side of the road, but the behavior and actions after indicate she was likely part of the hoax/incident in a closer way then we may realize. They needed a ‘third party witness’ to corroborate, like the truck stop sighting. All part of it right?

Big Signals:
Why is everyone suddenly leaving Redding/CA I wonder? (Except for SP and KP of course.)
Why did the local news guy suddenly quit/retire?
Why the sudden drip of dna and video details highlighting inconsistencies from LE?
Why the disappearance of social media lawyer NW and the pro-papinii reddit clan brigade?

Wither everyone has been called out by SCSO and told to leave the state, or they are all trying to avoid collateral damage.

Which leads me to:

There are other voices in this we haven’t heard from, people who may want to speak up now that some serious inconsistencies have been revealed and SPs story is no longer to be believed. They are prominent members of the community that were told a story and fell for it.

By my count there are 13-15 people in Redding and surrounding who have not been discussed publicly that have serious local influence and now have a valid reason to contact the family and SCSO for clarity in the case. Are they?

Have they been sent threatening letters to not discuss the case or be sued?

If it comes out that SP and KP lied in some material way about the kidnapping and it becomes public it was a hoax, any proactive legal action they took and communications to intimidate people who can provide support to build a case is called:

“Witness Tampering”.

So I wonder why the FBI is suddenly interested in the case again?"|15||||0||False|0|||False|0|15|Is Our I5 Original Spotter (AS) in Trouble?|28|

It seems those rumors were true and, if so, what else might their little gal have been into.  And just maybe this wasn't a random abduction by two Latino women rolling up on her in their SUV with hats and sunglasses, but maybe it was someone she was connected to in a personal situation which got out of control.

Of course there is some indication that SP had prior contact with JG and that's a whole different bag of worms.  

It would be nice if the SCSO cops would just do their job and put the facts out there.  They've had the skinny on what really went down here for a long time.  Enough with the coverup Jackson.

I doubt there is a coverup. Just different points of view in an ""emergency"" situation and KP's words. Did you ever see the movie Johnny Dangerously? The scene in jail where someone whispers something to another and says pass it on, and it changes with every person. While that's an exaggeration, it is human nature to put ones own spin on something they hear- whether it's their perception or its fabricated to be a more exciting story.

You realize she has some sort of emotional/mental illness, based on what we've learned of her past behaviors. Even if she *didnt*, this is a highly personal and more than likely embarrassing situation. Yes, it would be nice for US if she made a statement, or had someone make one for her but at this point no one would probably believe it, or at the very least, she'd be picked apart mercilessly. Considering her background, and hoping she is under some sort of psychiatric or therapeutic care, I'm pretty sure a professional would advise against any public appearances of any kind. She doesn't have to answer to the ""nation"", she has to answer to herself, her family and anyone or resources she, and perhaps Keith, have misused  this situation.

I also don't think, at this point for LE, it's a mystery that needs to be solved. I'm pretty sure they have a very good idea of what really happened. As much as I too would like to know the outcome, it seems to have become a situation that is really none of our business.

interesting thought. What if SP did flip this 100% back on KP? So many people in this could easily do that (Paps vs Gambles, for instance) to make themselves look like victims and the other party to look like the bad guy.  

We already (basically) know that SP was cheating on KP.  He should watch his back that she doesn't play the domestic violence card to get sympathy from everyone as well as a big alimony/child support payment in a divorce. 

In reverse, he could play the cheating card on her to get the kids in a divorce.  "|1||||0||False|0|||False|0|1|The Weekends Are the Time for Insiders To Appear?|39|

I think the case where the cops said it was a hoax but found out it wasn't played a huge part in how LE, or specifically Bosenko, presented this to the public. I think in that respect they are caught between a rock and a hard place.

I agree that they should give the money back if it was secured under false pretenses, and I agree she/they owe an apology to Go Fund Me donators, etc.

What I was saying is she doesn't owe us what really happened. I apologize if that wasn't clear. 

ETA: I'm not on SP's side, I just think there are extenuating circumstances in this case.

This is exactly what I think. I do believe however, that all these theories provide them with plenty of fodder to feed the SCSO. Some user posted something about a “Dark Theory”, I’m thinking it was SP/KP or someone close to them that posted it in order to float around different ideas to see what would stick to make the story more believable. MOO, but the only thing that’d make this story believable is the damn truth

It’s just so far fetched for so many reasons. The only people who think this could be sex trafficking, have very myopic understandings of that type of crime. I will add that anyone still thinking SP is a commodity in MX, really believes the stereotypes the media plays up about Mexico. If SP was held in some red room with her torture being streamed, it most likely would’ve ended with her dead. She certainly wouldn’t have been released with a new haircut, some scrapes and bruises, and a “brand” she could’ve inflicted herself. Her hair wasn’t dyed so the only attempt they made to conceal her identity was to cut her hair shoulder length????? 🙄|10||||0||1512855972.0|0|||False|0|10|It looks like the profile has been scrubbed from The Chive|82|https://i.redditmedia.com/CCtXhrBFKRdNPrvL5gyUjUSvfNdQvMhQDRdgcy5Cs_g.jpg?s=69fe6c63fb4d8a2ff571348bbac9a1e0

______________

Papini, a 34-year-old California mother of two disappeared during a November 2 jog, setting off a national media firestorm. Pleas for her safe return went unanswered. Then Cameron Gamble entered the case. Gamble, a 30-something self-professed abduction expert, said he had the backing of an anonymous donor offering $50,000 in exchange for Papini's safe return. Gamble described himself as a professional hostage negotiator, and the possible key to Papini's release.

But Gamble is no expert. Instead, his resume suggests an obscure self-defense coach, who appears to have inserted himself in a woman's disappearance to parlay it into fame and fortune.

Gamble made his first appearance in the Papini on November 18, more than two weeks after she disappeared, when he uploaded a video to YouTube.""My name is Cameron Gamble and I'm an international kidnap and ransom consultant,"" he said, sitting in a red desk chair against a white wall. ""I've been retained by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous, an individual who has come forward to offer a cash reward for a ransom for Sherri Papini's safe return to her family."""|9||||0||False|0|||False|0|9|Is this our CL Papini Ranter?

Either they had it very well planned, or she was held against her will. I mean it's not like she was held by two latinas, but I think it's quite likely that she was held by an ex-boyfriend/drugdealer for at least some of the time.

I think her husband suspected that right off and didn't think she had been picked up by some psychopath, murdered, and dumped somewhere.  I do think he was genuinely frightened about what might happen to her in the situation she was in, however.

I just don't believe Sherri is cunning enough to pull off a hoax and leave absolutely no evidence she's lying ... *and* not cave in interviews, especially with the FBI. And I've yet to see a believable explanation why the SCSO would cover for her and pretend to still be investigating it as an abduction a whole year later. Besides, that would require the FBI to cover for her, too. Not buying that.

I think Sherri lawyered up fast, refused to talk, so the LE covered for her because either they bungled the case somehow or they purposely covered for her because of pressure from locals/friends.

Like maybe she or an accomplice pretended to be holding her because Sherri a) had an affair with this ""Latina's' husband or b) stole from a pot farm.

I don't know who Sherri roped into this mess, but that's my guess - that the PI knew it was Sherri leaving all along but they had to play along with her crazy antics for her to come back.

What I’m seeing is a network of people who are all grasping for evidence, and the only people who truly can reveal details about the evidence available are the SCSO and SP/KP.

Very little detail has been released, and I’m feeling like the drips from lE are starting as a means to shake the tree to find participants in the scheme who have yet to be revealed publicly or via social media.

My guess is this extends to more people affected than we realize, and it’s appearing SCSO is getting pressure from many angles to suppress. There are people within SCSO who have a conflict as well, so it’s obvious two balancing acts are being played.

With the DNA evidence disclosure, however, it’s a real sign they are proceeding with an effort to conclude and move to next steps in the case."|9||||0||False|0|||False|0|9|54 Weeks Out From The Thanksgiving Miracle And SCSO Still Mum.|31|

That was obviously not true as they finally did produce this video from the south parking lot.

There is an account of a guy who went to the church to check out the cameras and said that they have 2 cameras at the front entrance.  She obviously went to the front entrance as we can see from the video released.

I suppose it's possible the entrance cameras weren't working or she didn't get within their view, but I find it highly unlikely.  I'm just wondering if they didn't release them because she didn't have her bag with her and maybe didn't have that chain attached yet."|10||||0||False|0|||False|0|10|54 Weeks Out From The Thanksgiving Miracle And SCSO Still Mum.|31|

I wonder if this is true, and the source of confusion from the original statement that ""there's nothing on the camera."" Maybe the JW spokesperson just looked at the front door camera and didn't see anything so he released the statement. Later, the police were able to find SP prancing around on footage from another camera and that's what was released.  

Either way, there really was no reason to release that footage. It didn't necessarily help her case, in fact just made us more suspicious of her seemingly healthy running ability.  They said they hoped it sparked someones memory...but who would wait a year to remember that they saw a lady in chains at 0400??

I wonder how much different the G's fortunes would be if people hadn't been skeptical of the SP ""abduction"" and she had not lost her memory and the cops had arrested the perpetrators and she had given interviews how the AD and CG's involvement had saved her life?

Too bad that she has amnesia and even the Mainstream Media has turned from embracing the narrative of a middle class blonde WASP mother of 2 abducted by some bad minority women to open skepticism with Newsweek even questioning if she is a liar. 

And poor old CG, rushing in where even angels fear to tread, has reaped the whirlwind.

What fabulous talent do they think they possess that the public should be falling over themselves to pay for?  Cammy spent a few years in the AF and for that I respect him (although serving  his full 4 years would earn a hell of a lot more respect), but that's about it. Neither of them even has any marketable education. 

CamGam seems to have had some decent jobs in construction and firefighting, why do they think those are beneath him now? I know they weren't glamorous and probably didn't pay enough to support a SAHM and 5 kids...but that's no one's fault but their own. I'm sure they could get financial aid to go back to school and get education/training for better paying jobs.

Sheriff Bo to Keith right after SP disappeared: *""Has she been seeing any other men?""*

KP: *""of course not, she would never do that or ever leave me or her family""*

Then later, Sheriff Bo to the guy from Detroit whose phone number was in SP's phone: *""Were you seeing Sherri?""*

Detroit guy: *""Yes, but I think she saw other guys too, surely her husband knew...""*

Sheriff Bo to Keith: *""has she ever done anything like this before or lied to you?""*

KP: *""No""*

Sheriff Bo: *""How about those police logs saying she did harm herself in the past then lie and blame other?""*

KP: *""You need to go tell the media all that is irrelevant, it doesn't affect her credibility nor mine, and the guy from Michigan isn't involved""*

Sheriff Bo: *""Sure, she'll turn up somewhere and claim she was injured by someone else.

I know most people that sell the MLM stuff are just trying to supplement their income or be able to stay at home with the kids.

Back in the early years of their marriage, before we simply gave up on the witch, I used to buy whatever she was selling, even tho I wasn't $rich$ by any means.  I finally wised up though.  I think she was selling whatever she wanted to be able to get at for free or at reduced prices at the time.  Her FB feed still makes me cringe-she's such a self-centered little blob.

I would make them meet me out with my friends so they can’t pick me up and this would happen many times before I deem them safe. And even then we’d be in public. I’ve never needed to use a dating app for guys but when I made a tinder as a joke since I made my bestfriend make one I just kept thinking how many of these dudes blowing me up are murderers or rapists and always felt the ones who super like me most likely to be a weirdo.

On my social media anytime a guy says let’s hangout or go out etc (and they never ask if I would want to but they assume I would when they have zero shot because they’re always not cute creepy guys who bother me and even a cute dude these rules would apply to) first I ask them where it is they think I live because they always assume I live where they do because either they’re too lazy to look or it’s hidden(but I’m pretty sure it’s not) or because we have mutual friends who live there(half the time I haven’t met them either and I just accepted them cause they were real people with many mutual ones and not creepy looking) but I tell them I don’t live there and then they try to act like I should come visit so I tell them I don’t travel to meet guys and only travel for friends and family sometimes or a bf or guy I’m seeing. Then they offer to drive sometimes and I then state my actual rule(sometimes I do this part first then the other part or just this part) which is I don’t go over to strangers homes and hangout alone with them and then they suggest public or try to claim they’re not a weirdo or that it’s worth it and I state that doesn’t matter and that I don’t hangout with guys alone unless I’m involved with them or they’re a gay bestfriend or other friend who’s driving us to meet our friends because hanging out alone with someone gives them the wrong idea so I only do with guys I’m more than friends with and they always ignore the hint that they’re friendzoned it strangerzoned and suggest we go out in public and I tell them I never meet up with guys I don’t know alone because I find it weird or awkward and don’t want them thinking it’s a date and that I make anyone I don’t know meet me with my friends and then they say they’re welcome to join(yet again ignoring if I actually want to meet them or where I live) to which I tell them that I tell every dude who wants to meet me that they’re welcome to say hi to me if they see me and my friends out and that when I’m in town I’m trying to see specific people or as many of my friends at once so I don’t make special trips to meet strangers(me and my friends would meet someone if we really wanted to but I like trying to get the point across) and that it’s nothing against them and my rule for every guy who asks and then they almost always try to make me change my rule or tell me it’ll be worth it or how great they are and I say that’s what every guy says because everyone thinks they’d be worth it but I no matter how normal the person seems will change the rules I have that protect my safety and protect awkward situations or my having to have some awkward just friends talk. Now they either accept this or they rage or get passive aggressive and half the time they try yet again months or weeks later and get pissy when I say it’s the same answer as before. Now you guys are thinking I’m a bitch I’m sure and you’re absolutely correct. Don’t get me wrong I’m a super nice sweet girl but I’m bothered so much by dudes who try the same crap that I just use the same replies and usually I don’t even reply to most my messages because I’m only on there these days to talk to my guy who’s in Australia and uses Facebook messenger to talk to me. 

I mean I had some guy from India who had been harassing me for over a year in new profiles when I blocked him and somehow getting into my list even though I denied him(again I’m super careful about who I add and even when I was getting 100-200 requests a day for a month or so which was awful on my thumbs) and always ignoring my saying not to send me anymore messages and that I wasn’t interested in being his friend(that one was after a month or so of being bothered) and don’t add random dudes who have no mutual friends or trying to add me or poke me etc and I had gave up on blocking and was just not replying though my ocd made it so I had to read it so he also knew I was ignoring him and it didn’t keep saying I had one message. So last week I know he’d waved at me on there but I ignored it but then he sent me a msg that I mistook for from someone else and replied to and being fed up with him existing I replied saying that was an accident and to never message me again and that we aren’t friends and I don’t like him. He ignored it then tries making small talk so I was very mean and then he sends me some you’re gonna regret that meme and tell me “it’s ok now there’s only exit door for you” then I tell him if he’s trying to threaten me he should probably not sound so stupid and th the are many doors for me and he says “th the were but now there are only one and that is the exit door” I then tell him actually the door was never open because I never wanted to be his friend and never would even answer if he knocked and that my home has more than one door but he’d never know that cause I wouldn’t allow him to have number let alone my address so no doors were ever open and I never would want them open and to not try and reply unless he wants it added to the screenshots I’m gonna share(my method to call someone out is screenshot them then post those and screenshot that and send them it before blocking) so he then tries to sound tough and act as if he wasn’t hitting on me and I’m ugly and not deserving of him and I should not try to reply so I basically write something mean as can be and blocked him after making sure he knows I shared the screenshots which is when I see it says he’s my friend but I hadn’t added him. So my point is even if it’s not a dating app you can deal with creepy people who threaten your life.

I was a nerd long before it was popular so I had a hard time meeting women and being successful at getting them to go out with me.

Funny thing, as I got older I got to be less and less of a social misfit and quite relaxed with myself and over the bulk of my insecurities and started developing friendships and started finding it very easy to meet women.

Funny!  It's kind of like the banks, when you need it they won't loan you money, but when you don't need it, they keep offering to loan you all kinds of money.  

In my 60's I still used to chat up attractive women who wandered into the twilight zone of our little town and bar.  Sometimes I would get phone numbers for the heck of it but then would wish them goodnight and climb in my old chevy pickup with my dogs and go home.  My friends would ask me what I was doing and I would reply, just like fishing, ""catch and release"":)

Now I don't bother and just climb in the old pickup with my dogs and go home.

I think all of us, male and female need to be mindful of this and understand that women and girls are targeted in unimaginable ways. Hunted, basically.

I think most normal, nice men understand this and try not to scare or intimidate women and go out of their way to make women not feel threatened but our society is jacked up.

People don't speak up when they see a female being mistreated or intimidated.

Society doesn't encourage women to be defensive and vocal, it's seen us women being crazy, bitchy, and out of line because it doesn't serve the needs of the sick few hat want to harm women for their own pleasure and exploit them.

I came to Chicago from a very small, safe, town by myself for university when I was 17.  

I always wore shoes I could run in, I always stayed alert. I was still assaulted.

I would be teased and taunted for avoiding elevators, ""el"" train and subway trains with only men or a man in the rain car or for crossing the street if I HAD to walk alone and there was a male(s) approaching or behind.  Sometimes if I would walk in the middle of the street so I had my peripheral vision at max potential because even before I was pulled into an alley an assaulted at 10 o'clock in the morning on the way to the train for an 11 o'clock class.

I was accused of being racist, crazy, rude, and all sorts of horrible things.

One time I was on the train and I moved seats because a man was being very inappropriate and I felt threatened. He followed me and I continued to ignore him while I tried to figure out my next defensive move. Well he didnt like that and he announced on the train ""I'm gonna spit on this bitch, so wants to see me spit on this bitch? She thinks she all that and that she too good to talk to me because I'm Black."" This went on and on for what seemed like an eternity to me while I closed my mouth and eyes bracing myself so that his spit wouldn't go in any of my orifices. And I prayed someone would stand up for me on this full train car. No one did.  The guy spit on me and ran out. After he left an opportunistic guy tried to act like he saved me and tried to tend to and help me wipe the spit from my hair and ask for my phone number.

I was so happy to have the chance to pursue my education as I had come from a poor hardworking family and I wanted to make them proud and do well in the big city. It was really hard and I almost failed because after several traumatic experiences I did become agoraphobic briefly and I stopped going to class and work. I was very diligent and reliable prior to that but no one noticed the changes in or asked if I was ok, granted I was pretty good about acting normal to my family and friends.

I tell my sons all the time ""no girl has to talk to you, had to look at you"" don't approach girls on the street, never leave your car to talk to a girl she will think you are going to kidnap her.  And just remember that us girls know we are hunted and that's something that men don't have to fear as much or even at all depending on who you are. 

The reality for females is frightening but we want to be unafraid to go to university, to travel, to commute to work, to go to parties. And we don't want to have to worry we will be perceived as crazy or racist if feel uncomfortable. We don't want to offend anyone we just don't want to be harmed. 

If we are friendly we get accused of being flirty or sending mixed messages.

If we are ""stand offish"" due to a need for self preservation we are ""bitches"" that should ""smile more""


Sorry for long post, I haven't relieved some of these memories for so long that I got carried away/emotional

I want our daughters, friends, ourselves, sisters, mothers, to feel safe and supported 

And yeah faking an abduction or lying to cover it up is disgusting considering the reality that females are being hunted, tortured, and their lives taken!"|9||||0||False|0|||False|0|9|Another young woman goes missing 20 mi east of Yolo|59|https://i.redditmedia.com/J7arVe_Zqq0rqLNw9ARtkg7TEMwstXZwpD-QUALW958.jpg?s=0fe973cf54ccbf451d7ee2dceb1c7d3e

I have taught my daughters to NEVER trust anyone - least of all any man when you are in private.  Terrible that I would have to do that but it is for their own safety.  As I partially related once in a separate discussion, one of my daughters DID have a young man stalk her and threaten her and I instantly threw my entire efforts and ""would have mortgaged the house"" if necessary to get a lawyer, file an ""OP"" (order of protection) and do whatever it took to seek justice.

This is why it stuns me that Sherri's husband and family have done NOTHING to go after the perpetrators - I would have a legion of private investigators out there knocking on every door until I found them & I would be demanding the Sheriff do more - but Keith's silence speaks volumes that he doesn't care or doesn't believe it happened."|5||||0||False|0|||False|0|5|Another young woman goes missing 20 mi east of Yolo|59|https://i.redditmedia.com/J7arVe_Zqq0rqLNw9ARtkg7TEMwstXZwpD-QUALW958.jpg?s=0fe973cf54ccbf451d7ee2dceb1c7d3e

Men don't have to worry about walking to their cars in a parking garage at night. They don't have to carry their keys in a strategic way, or worry that we were nice to the wrong person who will misinterpret it and stalk/rape/murder us for it. Us women have to live in fear of these things **All.The.Time.**  Yet, as you said, we are also expected to be open and friendly to everyone or be considered a bitch.  It's bullshit.

I didn't speak about what happened to me for like six years.  When I told my husband,  he cried and I immediately stopped crying to comfort him. Because what I was saying was upsetting him, and women are supposed to make life easier for men. That's stupid,  and I knew it was stupid, but being told that your whole life really takes a hold. Later, my mother was yelling at me on the phone,  ""what's wrong with you,  what happened to you,  why are you so different. You're not the girl I sent to college. What's wrong with you."" And I snapped. I was angry and blurted it out and then my arms went numb. And she said,  triumphantly, ""I KNEW IT!"" And I immediately realized I should have kept my mouth shut. Because that information wasn't used to help,  it was used to justify behaviors she didn't like (because she didn't raise a child to have anxiety, or any sort of fear of the world. Despite all those 'men in vans will kidnap and murder you, never talk to strangers' talks we had.)

We want to talk about duty but there's a lot of victim blaming that goes on. SP could have been on a really consensual thing that went very badly south. Drugs could have been involved. But the narrative that many, many people would sadly say was that she was doing bad things, so bad things happened to her.  Or maybe everything was consensual and she walked into a story that had already been written for her and it was just easier to go with it. To comply. 

My point is,  the ""well then they should say something"" argument isn't always the best argument. If someone is comfortable enough to release sketches, yeah,  absolutely.

However it is easy to see the trappings in which they don't say those things,  and that sucks.

I wouldn't bat an eye if they came out and said something like ""we refuse to let fear stop us from living our lives in the house we love,"" but instead they have told us how scared and reclusive SP is.

I'm thankful for you that you had a protective father.

I was an easy target, father ran away, I was the oldest of a bunch of kids. My mother was pregnant with the last when he bolted. Being the oldest I was very independent and a very attractive target for pedos and bad guys in general. Was easy for me to manipulated into silence by the simple threat ""if you tell anyone I'll hurt your little sisters and brothers"" and I wanted to protect them, I was raised to be ""a good big sister""

I'm still protective but I'm no longer silent. I'm outspoken for better and also for worse. 

No matter how strong we are as Individuals it still really difficult seeing these stories in the news about these missing people.

I was so worried about Sherri and her kids but then shit started to not add up and my concerns started to shift.

Even if SP was targeted due to something she did wrong or illegal involvement, which isn't my theory, the perps still need to be apprehended and there could still be a danger to the public because that type of vigilante justice isn't ok

Being on the periphery of two lawsuits, a person can get a summary judgment but never collect because 1) they have to file the judgment in the State(s) the losing party works/lives in, and 2) the losing party can hide their assets or not have any. 

If the Gambles own no property, have no wages to garnish and have no money in bank accounts or retirement accounts to seize, the Plaintiff won’t be able to collect.

A common way for crooks to hide assets is to not have a W2 type job (avoid garnishment), don’t own a home and put assets under relatives names. "|2||||0||False|0|||False|0|2|New entry in the Court files for the Cameron/Jen lawsuit|16|

In addition, her deception with self injury on prior documented police logs, her secretive liasons with men she barely knew from out of state, and the complete absence of even one other single supportive fact like fingerprints, DNA that matches someone in the criminal databases, or the finding of a place that fits the description of her holding cell, convinces the SCSO that we should immediately close this investigation until someone can show us any reason in creation to keep wasting our time and embarrassing all of us with this stunt."""|8||||0||False|0|||False|0|8|We need a place to gather primary source material.|52|

Can you cite any that support the version of what happened according to Sherri Papini?

The only facts that can be verified are

-she disappeared- altho there were reports of people spotting her in and around Shasta Co. in the 3 weeks before she re-appeared.

-she reappeared 3 weeks later about 150 miles away but cannot give any convincing account where she was ""held"" for 3 weeks.

-she had gotten injured but nobody seems to know with certainty to what degree. Even her own claims about the injuries (like the cut to the foot) are NOT supported by PHOTO evidence and appear to be disputed.

-there were a whole lot of odd, weird, and pretty unusual things about Sherri, including but not limited to - she had prior police reports of injuring herself then blaming others and attacking her own family, she had contacted an out-of-state man for some purpose to meet up with him and had done so also in the past, her own family had argued that there was no such man but obviously they were wrong, she claims to have been taken by two women in an SUV but despite many witnesses & video surveillance being reviewed by police, NOBODY ever saw any suspects or any SUV, and nobody in either Shatsa Co. nor Yolo Co. can add even one tiny bit of witness account to support even a single thing she says.  

Her husband, family, and even all the law enforcement personnel cannot be counted as corroborating witnesses since they saw NOTHING and are only repeating what she said, thus their testimony carries zero additional weight.

Nothing else she has claimed from the chains to the brand to the injuries could NOT have been caused at her own hand...altho it is not ruled out that perhaps someone else was involved.....but she cannot add any info to help solve the case or support he claims."|9||||0||False|0|||False|0|9|We need a place to gather primary source material.|52|

After you've enabled the wiki (and double-check, but I'm pretty sure you can turn it off any time you wish as well), you can start adding and editing information.

YOU had a 4 fucking day long coronary with the word RIDICULE!

You.just.wouldnt.shut.up.about.it!!

Then YOU go and help US WRITE OUT the new rule all legal and wordy sounding so you can have better clarification of when TO and when NOT TO act like a douche, RIGHT?

So now YOU got a problem with a RULE THAT YOU HELPED WRITE??

Because me saying in layman's terms Remember the rules and just DONT BE A DOUCHE, Don't be an asshole and just ridicule people for the Hell of it, is not legal and precise enough???

WHY are you being such a BABY??
YOU HELPED WRITE THE RULE! 

Is GOODBYE a threat or a promise? 
Otherwise, sit down and shut up!

The intent was to remind and clarify about existing general standards of conduct. We've never expected people to be squeaky clean.  The idea for a town hall actually came out of this comment from Teflon93:

>>>**You’ll need to choose between fostering open discussion (which the vast majority of us want) or appeasing those who want no discussion save the aping of Nicole Wool’s talking points. Past history around here points the way forward.**

In the town hall conversation we saw that many people misunderstood the policy to be a complete policing of all negative talk or humor. Teflon93 himself had suggested the following clarification, and it seemed like an appropriate template for a resolution:

>>>**Why not establish a non-arbitrary standard instead?
Such as:
“Comments/posts which consist of nothing more than ridicule of another poster’s appearance, religion, political persuasion, or command of the English language are subject to immediate deletion.” That would be reasonable enough to me.**"|10||Moderator||0|moderator|False|0|||False|0|10|Rule Update|80|

I also tried to tell you that nothing has changed about the way we will be moderating. Our moderation style has always been one of maintenance rather than patrol. You've admitted that you've never been censored by this moderation team, so I'm really puzzled by your beef. Like I said, if you see it up on the sub, it's probably OK to say. There's plenty of content up that one person or another would find in bad taste or even downright offensive. We aren't here to police that. We created a simple non arbitrary rule for you. 

And my personal measure of value has nothing to do with how closely my opinion matches a person or even how controversial their tone or opinions may or may not be. Value comes in many forms. Perhaps it's finding new information, opening a debate, or just being a funny and pleasant person."|10||Moderator||0|moderator|False|0|||False|0|10|Rule Update|80|

Have you seen Reddit threads in which moderators will log different reports, to publicly address them? 

No, we didn't receive reports in regard to that issue. In fact, we have not received reports about Sherri Papini's appearance either. The issues with misuse of our reporting option were explained in the original post authored by u/KissMyCrazyAzz. Both the report reminder and reminder to not ridicule were two separate issues and decisions. 

We have not received reports in direct correlation to that issue. We wanted to make sure everyone knew that insulting the appearance of anyone in a non-constructive fashion is not an acceptable thing to do in /r/thepapinis.  This is our decision. We would like the subreddit to be a civil and kind place. We would also like to avoid admin intervention.

(Great Find Puff).  Puff found the black and white ""bum gun"" (say that 3 times in a row) photo on another website indicating that the B&W ""bum gun"" photo MIGHT BE A stock photo and probably not SP.  And if the black and white ""bum gun"" is not SP then the colored ""bum gun"" is probably not her either.  That then leaves the ""stomach zipper"" photo which is most likely SP because of the freckle location?  But here are my thoughts broken down into ""odds"".  What are the ""odds"" that an online anonymous handle that SP has been known to use for other websites (i.e. Tcash9) is also the user name of a site on Chive which has risqué photos of a blonde (with hair like SP) holding a gun. (she seems to be fond of firearms based on her other sites). Afterall,  SP has been known to use stock photos (that are not her on her other sites but look like her from the back...e.g. the running/exercise pictures)  

I'll just leave you with this.  I cannot tell when these pictures on Chive (on Tcash9) were posted but does anyone suspect a ""Troll"" might have created this site?  It wouldn't be too hard to do.  I mean some Troll created those SG and KP Twitter accounts.  Possibly QuickDrawMcgraw?

Edit: Possibly an earlier Internet search (i.e. a few months or a year ago) did not reveal this account because a Troll just created it?  Uh?  Maybe?

Usually fake breasts look pretty stiff/torpedos for a little while. It also has a lot to do with the original shape of the breast before augmentation too. For example, some girls who already have the pretty tear drop shape before surgery could very well have nice, full breasts like in these photos. 

Dunno if this is tmi, but I had mine done 3 years ago and it was really until the last year and a half or 2 that they really started normalizing and looking “not as fake/more natural”. It takes time for them to loosen up and your body to accept them, in a way. 

Also, augmentation could be done under the boobies, in the under arm area, or via belly button (how mine were done). That way you can choose where you want your scars, haha.

I don't really have a point that's probably why it's confusing. . .besides I don't think it was an afterthought that she was selling those items. It's not like she was cleaning out her closets and reselling the never worn or lightly worn items, she had forethought and was planned. Not that significant. Also seems like she didn't want pics inside her home or outside to be revealing so she used sheets or on the scuffed up floor (which I found to be tacky and unsanitary)"|11||||0||False|0|||False|0|11|TCash9 Risque Photos|290|https://i.redditmedia.com/G_Iemch4k2OTPI8k4DYMMh-jr3UTr3WGaJWHZQx9LCs.jpg?s=c79cf635f42f8ad29d51642d0956b90f

Someone should just message the guy and ask where he got the photo, maybe he has a source.  Looks like he’s made a lot of woman and guns posts on that xdtalk site though.

A couple of pages after (503 about halfway down) there is a photo of a woman with a similar body type wearing a similar garter posing with what looks like a fake plastic ak-47.  Don’t know if it’s related but it made me take a second look.

It is interesting that the photos don’t yield many results when doing a reverse image search.  I would have thought those kind of pictures would get shared on a lot of forums.  A reverse image search doesn’t find the tcash9 chive.com page so there are limitations when doing a reverse image search.

SP was very likely an escort, makes a lot more sense than drugs. 

By trying to make it a ‘sex trafficking’ narrative, she is a victim. Right?

Why else would the family lean on local news contacts, family animal control officers with SCSO insider positions, and hire an attorney/media consultant to advise them on how to properly use cease and desist letters?

Every so often she does a closet cleanout and we get TONS of stuff she's only worn once, or stuff with the tags still on that she can't return because you can get banned from returning too often.

In the last batch, there were FOUR down jackets.  Don't get me wrong; I'm grateful.  We have three kids and she has saved us ungodly amounts of money. But I feel bad because I think it's problematic to spend that much on clothing you'll only wear once, or a few times.

- A picture of the ""brand""

- The name & identity of the guy in Michigan (and any & all other men she was seeing & texting)

- The list of SP's recent texts & phone calls

- What the surveillance videos from the nearby gas station & other businesses showed - and also - what did the surveillance video on the Kingdom Hall show 2.5 hours after SP was kidnapped on Nov. 2?  Did it show a large dark SUV exiting I-5 and driving by the ""church""?

- Any fingerprints on anything?  The chain, any other article SP had?  Any tire tracks where SP claims the SUV was when she was taken?

- Pictures of the injuries and the ER report - or at least a summary of their findings.

- Then an answer to all the discrepancies - like...

...why did the Kingdom Hall staff state nobody was seen on the videos, then a year later, SCSO shows that Sherri was?

...why wasn't there far more aggressive searching going on down in Yolo when the cops knew right away that Sherri was driven 2.5 hours south immediately after begin forced into the van?  They should have gone door to door and set up a perimeter and searched for the vehicle.

...why did SP's family and people close to her claim there WAS no man from Michigan, and that Sherri absolutely was NOT planning to meet anyone and NEVER leave her kids - then we have proof that's exactly what she WAS planning?

...why the discrepancy on the times she was seen running?

...why was she sent home if the injuries were so bad?

...why didn't SCSO insist SP answer the questions and give a description instead of waiting weeks to get the details and a year to produce sketches - claiming SP's memory would get better over time - a complete CONTRADICTION to common sense - that everyone knows your memory gets worse with more time passing.?

...why the suspicious connection between the anonymous donor and the woman who saw SP at the truck stop?

...in fact why was the woman who called 911 hailed as a hero, appeared on national TV and she even tried to collect the reward - then SCSO says it was a truck driver who called 911 and stopped?

...why did the police on the scene on I-5 plainly state that Sherri was CHAINED TO SOMETHING, and the eyewitness who called 911 stated she saw Sherri's ""long blond hair"" when later it was revealed she wasn't chained to anything, and her hair was supposedly chopped off?

...why did Keith claim Sherri's wrists were bound with hose clamps, when later it was said it was her ankles that had the hose clamps?

...why was the phone laid carefully and staged with the hair intertwined with the earbuds that even Sheriff Bosenko said appeared *""“neatly placed” rather than lost in a struggle. “It appeared they had been set in some grass with the screen facing up, and then the earbuds to the phone were loosely coiled and appeared to be placed on the screen""*

...why did the Sheriff downplay the old blogs and stonewall & try to hide the public info about SP's past police logs?

...the fact that NOT a trace of the ""kidnappers"" has ever surfaced, their DNA apparently has never been databanked and even the one who was supposedly shot - was never seen in the ER and never found?

- Lastly - why is there NO outrage and urgency or demand to solve this crime?
Why is it not being discussed openly or have press conferences to get help from the public since the SCSO seems to have ineptly blown the investigation and not found a thing despite the hundreds of leads and tips, and the dozens of warrants and videos?
WHY shouldn't the public still be terrified that violent kidnappers - perhaps even MURDERERS are still on the loose in Shasta Co.?  Give us one thing that should calm the public's fears that anyone else - or any pretty young woman jogging in Shasta Co. might suffer the same fate?"|11||||0||1512412508.0|0|||False|0|11|SCSO - This Is The Week To Close Out Old Business For the Year.|13|

He/she didn't want to get into that Michigan Man subject as he/she had went dark for some time after it was revealed that his/her princess was texting MM and planning to meet him just about the time she went missing.  That was a real blindside.  I believe his/her predecessor stated emphatically that there was no MM and he/she was still stating that there were zero problems in the marriage.

He/she did want us to redirect our time and energies to find those 2 Latino banditas however, rather than spending all of our time questioning his princess's fairy tale.  I, for one, would love to find those 2 ladies and would like to hear from anyone knowing their identities or whereabouts.  I think that they may be a couple of fictional characters resurected from SP's old Skinheadz short story however.  And one of them could now be dead or wounded and the other probably has a few teeth missing from that toilet bowl head slam.

Matter of fact, now that I'm pretty well convinced that she was driven to the Woodland/Yolo area on November 2 and resided in the area to her release, I would like to hear from anyone who might know something of her hosts.  I guess that her extended duration stay could also include the Chico area where she had some old contacts including some of Hispanic ethnicity.

Late last night I posted to other thread in response to SquashKaush and I think it must have been shortly after that their account was deleted.  I certainly didn't mean to say anything to drive him/her away.  In fact, my intention was quite the opposite.  I was hoping SquashKaush would stay around.  I'm all for looking at all sides to an issue and I don't mind if someone does not agree with my own thoughts or opinions.  I didn't see any reason why this person would be made to feel unwelcome or under attack.  It seems like every time someone comes on here that tries to defend SP, people jump on that person right away and get hostile.  Why do that?  Whoever it was obviously believes SP's story and believes that there are 2 suspects that are on the loose needing to be caught.  That's their opinion and I don't mind hearing what they have to say.  I actually thought it would be interesting to find out why they feel so sure her story is true.  

Edit to add: this was the comment I posted in the other thread to SquashKaush:

I don't see the point of it. Debating is fun, but when people get nasty I don't see the point of engaging with them any longer. I don't see that you said anything rude that should have made SK leave. 

 I'd like to see more Pap defenders on here, personally.  I'm so undecided that if they had good points, I might be swayed to believe the official story (at least some parts of it). Unfortunately, many of them seem to come on with a chip firmly on their shoulder to start with; that leads ""us"" to be rude back and a vicious cycle begins.  That's why I think the Pap defenders we've encountered are actually part of the story, no random person who happens to believe SP's account should be **that** invested in the story. 


 Hell, most people were even very polite to freaking JenGam (when she was finally using her own name lol).  I think most of us know that you attract more flies with honey or whatever.

She couldn't very well waltz into the house like she had just returned from a business trip and ask hubby, ""how have you and the kids been faring while I was on my trip"".  After all the world was looking for her, even the Spanish speaking world.  The cops had diverted all their resources away from hard crime to try to figure out where she was.  They even sent two of their busy gumshoes to the motor city.  And then there were the good hearted, well meaning concerned folks of Shasta County who searched for her for days and raised the $50k GFM to bring her home.  And there was SK and the family who were genuinely worried for her life although there may have been at least one doubter who was pretty sure that her daughter would show up in a couple of weeks.

And don't forget the Mayor of Redding and the city council and all the folks organizing the balloon release.

No, she had to be found bound, branded, abused, and much lighter than when she left.  Better yet some bad ass minorities were responsible.  Might have even been the same gang who called her daddy a Nazi and she banged one of their heads into the bleachers and one of them broke her leg the next day.

I still think the member of the A team with deep Woodland/Yolo ties went down with a few packs of $100 bills and arranged the Thanksgiving miracle.

I can tell story after story of the extreme lies my Histrionic people have told and the crazy things they have done. “My Sherri” walked in the woods barefoot in the snow and broke into her own house rather than be dropped off and walk in the front door — because she wanted to keep up the appearance of a lie she told her boyfriend.  It’s not as extreme as 22 days, but telling the truth (about something truly innocuous) would have been so much simpler.

I’ve followed other high profile cases - some seem like slam dunks - and have heard through the locals that they know what happened and who did it, but the prosecutor won’t press charges unless they have a missing piece - like a smoking gun. 

Often it’s the result of office politics and in one big murder case I believe sadly it’s to do with money - as in holding a trial and pursing a conviction with the evidence they have would cost the county more money than they have in their annual budget because the evidence while compelling isn’t strong enough.

I can’t believe in this case though that Jackson would set himself up for a media storm by baiting them and us that he has more info and WILL release it. 

I say release it buddy - Sherri will never ever take any blame or a plea so pressuring her won’t work."|7||||0||False|0|||False|0|7|Media Pressure On The SCSO For Disclosure|39|

Whoa tho, I'm sittin here chillin, and that makes a lot of sense.

The fact that she apparently can't remember from where on the main street, or near the mailboxes she was kidnapped from is weird, but if 'not remembering if I got kidnapped from home or not' is on the table, then ya that's a BS sign. 

When I went there, I didn't drive up to their house and get out to take a bunch of photos and wave HI! That's rude and tacky. (I live in the Sierra Mountains myself. I'm not messing with no country folks in a County that can Carry, and is ran by a MegaChurch into supernatural soul sucking. Talking here on Reddit, and being there, is whooooole other world, so I haven't been doing much researching or writing about it since I was there.)No matter what, I can't stand seeing reporters just camping out on city street, jumping at the ready to see you wake up and take a shit. That's pathetic. Ugh, anyway.
I got as many pics as I could of the area and layout. I just posted the best ones I got on the site. 

I don't think I thought of that theory, cuz the big many mailbox entrance is just kind of the Main one. When folks google map this location, you have to put it in the real life view. It's all gravel. Bumpy rough road other than little sections of 'paved personal areas in front of garage' type of paved. Little spiderwebs of dense trees and driveways to houses and easement driveways to several others houses everywhere. 100 different directions to jog thru the woods and meet at the several main roads all within a mile or two of there.

She made sure to be seen at the mailboxes, talking on a phone, which was maybe when she planted the phone, (or kp did later) then went home or walked the opposite direction thru the woods a mile or two to a completely different road and pick up location. This is interesting. I hadn't thought about the present being her trying to imply one abduction site, while kp maybe finding the phone or planting it, brought in another theory and she hasn't ""officially"", other than here, said a fucking word otherwise. 

I could have sworn someone said they had exterior cameras so I'd assume they were there already, which is why I hadn't thought about the abduction being at the house."|8||Moderator||0||False|0|||False|0|8|Media Pressure On The SCSO For Disclosure|39|

It just doesn't make sense to half-wrap a gift then decide to go for a run.  You either don't start or you finish it, it's like a 1 minute job.  The present thing is a strange detail, and not sure one KP would have mentioned if he planted the phone but he seems like kind of an over-talker so I wouldn't rule any of that out.  I would love to know whether or not the front door was locked when KP arrived, and if she had her house key.  If she ""went for a jog"" she would have locked the door (cash sitting on the night stand, they live in a sketchy area, etc.). That would tell us so much.

Great point about the direction she could have gone after leaving the house too.

I don’t think Suzanne ever liked being around SP and her attention ways but is more mature than Sherri and just put up with her. Also interesting that she has since moved away- she probably was the only one of KP’s clan who wasn’t in denial and wanted to distance herself from this whole mess. (Side note: anyone else remember that SuzP is an actress and used to teach Keith how to act when they were kids? Bet she cringes every time she sees one of her “let’s pretend to cry” lessons play out on TV.) 

Rod is a mess. SP had him hoodwinked like all the other males. By now he’s heard the truth but has too much pride to admit he was wrong/give up the fight. Besides, no one can break from the story anyway.

Keith’s dad Ken never really bought in. (See his FB comments/newspaper quotes). KP and SP probably weren’t that close to him bc he didn’t buy them trips or free babysitting.

The Graeffs knew right away their pain in the ass daughter had done it again. (LG had even warned Keith about her wily ways before they got married.) But since they had to kinda play along, they made their minimal statements and went back to candy crush and Mexican food. I doubt they’ve seen them much if at all since her return. 

The wild card is Kathleen. We know nothing about her. I’d love to know how she felt/feels about this, but my speculation is that she kind of hides behind Rod and loves Keith to pieces so she supports him and his decision to defend his trollop wife.

One thing’s for sure, if SP hoped to get attention and admiration from her family from this scheme, her plan backfired.

My guess is they are distancing - hence the reports of living a reclusive life.

I wonder what SK thinks after she was out there on the cameras genuinely scared for her sister's life and her abduction by strangers and then finds out about MM and perhaps other aspects of what really happened.  I would have a hard time forgiving and probably would isolate from that sibling but, of course, I don't know the dynamics and am only guessing.

Betraying the public and good hearted GFM donators is one thing, but family is another.

Suzanne seemed like she was biting her tongue and being very patient with all the dopes who were buying the story.  They both seemed to want to help however they could. I wasn’t getting a strong conviction from them.

Suzanne P is playing for the team. She’s putting her own feelings aside that this is total bullshit and emphasizing Sherri’s structured days - I don’t even know what that means like lunch is at 12 on the dot and we wash our hands at 11:55? She kept repeating structure and of course coined the term supermom.

I got the impression she didn’t want to rock the boat, this isn’t her problem so she’ll pretend to go along if it makes her brother, mom and too-involved RR3 happy.

As for the other family members, I don’t think her mom has seen her since she came back, her dad looks a sandwich shy of a full lunchbox and the Papinis don’t want Keith embarrassed so pretend it’s all true.

Suz (Keith's sis)-my take was a way younger girl who didn't register the potential seriousness of being ""TAKEN"", but was looking forward to being on TV.  Again, just my impressions of this interview.  

Sherri's family knows her much better than the Pap Fam does. The Graeffs know what SP is capable of.  I don't think anyone calls the Po-Po on a family member without some serious thought.  Likewise, I don't think they'd call the cops on SP multiple times without reason.  

Much like getting rid of a problem employee means you won't give out ALL the info to someone checking references, I doubt Keith's family ever knew the full extent of Sherri's bullshit.  Well, they sure know now!  Wonder how much of the info that came out was new to them, and to Keith?  He's probably been sitting around stunned the last 10 months or so!  

Whatever happened would have changed Sherri's relationships with her family, Keith's fam, and Keith himself.  I doubt she enjoys all the approval she used to get from Keith's mum & RRIII.  Suzanne probably told her brother exactly what she thought of his wife.  And Sheila made her escape.

There were a couple of references in the comments section of this video, to Casey Anthony.  Does everyone remember Casey actually has a brother?  He sure didn't have much to do with his sister after it was revealed that his niece was found dead.  It may be that SP generated the same reaction among both sides of the family."|4||||0||False|0|||False|0|4|SP and Family|24|https://i.redditmedia.com/yeA7tq3hOy5iTF9Ce07K6kWTT99Lseq7D-FXF05aBBo.jpg?s=3234049336748826f21c958756184101

BUT --- how did she become involved....?

-If the Papini family hired her, then what difference does it make whether she asks for pay - they are still hiring a publicity agent - which people do to get a TV or movie deal or to promote their story for monetary gain...

-But if Nicole Wool approached the Papini family unsolicited, then I think that's even worse!  It makes her the slimiest ambulance-chaser of a publicity agent preying upon someone's misery by promising to get her famous and likely make a bunch on her own in the meantime.

Either way - the mere fact Nicole Wool is involved all the more makes this case a media circus and makes LIARS out of all the Papinis and their defenders who claim *""they really are a very private family and they just want to be left alone.""*  

BS- everything they have ever done - from their public blogs to their press agent to their multiple efforts to get their faces and interviews on TV and in the press - they have proved themselves to be publicity seekers of the first order - reminding me of Balloon Boy's dad.  If they just took 1% of the time they spend seeking publicity and spent that on trying to help catch the ""kidnappers"", then I'd say their story at least might be believable. - 

.

ONE more thing- for a supposedly famous Hollywood publicity agent - she sure is dam*ed obscure....barely findable even with an internet search - and unless she's a ""secret agent"" - she had no clients anywhere that she can cite who anyone's ever heard of.

As far as I know she only made that one comment after the media got those old police reports and published them:

>""Sherri Papini and her family are the very recent victims of an extremely violent crime that has painfully and dramatically changed the course of their lives forever. It is shameful that a media outlet would intentionally exploit Sherri and Keith Papini and their young children's trauma for the sole purpose of clickbait and selling papers.""

>The statement continues, ""This newspaper’s decision to aggressively seek out and publish unsubstantiated online activity and distort phone conversations from 16 years ago is victim-blaming at its most egregious. It is our hope that the media will honor their privacy as they work through this difficult time."" 

http://www.krcrtv.com/news/local/shasta/sherri-papinis-family-responds-to-report-of-prior-911-calls/426256953

It's hard to tell what went on there but sister SK, who was an amateur, didn't want to/couldn't because of having her baby/the family wanted a professional or all for all of those reasons stepped back from it.  

Ms. Wool seemed to be struggling in her business and only had one anchor client and now I think that business is defunct.  Perhaps she thought the Ps could be a good client if she could get the media, publishing, and film deals for them.  Problem is she probably discovered that the established narrative was a fairy tail and the Ps weren't ready to come out with the nasty details, so there was little there for her. 

So my guess is that the Ps are without a publicity agent at this time and that's why KP put out the simple ""thank you to supporters"" statement after the latest LE revelations.

The Ps won't be able to cash in until they disclose what really happened and, so far, are unwilling to do that, so there really is nothing there for someone like Ms. Wool working on commission only.

As far as the one time reddit poster's comment, it sounds like a cut and paste from her inflated bio on her old venture's web site and probably was posted by her or someone close.  Come to think of it, it sounds a lot like CG's bio:)

There must have been a great degree of certainty that she believed it was SP at that truck stop to have made her call LE as soon as they drove away.  If she just spotted her from a distance I can see it maybe being more of a case of mistaken identity, but the fact that she went right up to the truck and spoke to SP and looked directly at her makes me think there may be some credibility to her claim.  I'd be very curious to know more details about her interaction with that person and how that person appeared (how long/short was her hair? did the person look tired?  notice any bruises or chains?  was there anything else in the vehicle that looked suspicious?  did LE mention that they followed up on her lead?)

They would have shared that with Keith, right? If so, he had to know during the interview. Maybe he believes it was innocent texting (back to my gullible theory), explained away. So he didn't think it was relevant to the perfect wife story he sold on 20/20. She is still perfect and would never leave him. Whatever questions they asked him on the Polygraph, he was truthful. Heck, he could have said he knew she was cheating but had nothing to do with her disappearance. He could have admitted he was tracking her ass down using findmyiphone cause he thought she was shacked up somewhere. They could know a ton of stuff that he told them. He doesn't have to share that with the public, nor does LE. But if that's true, Bosenko never should have gone on 20/20.

Sherri was sick & tired of Keith, and was devising her exit strategy to make her look good.  After all, she still needed the support of all of Keith's relatives for child care purposes.  She didn't get much support from the Graeff side of the family.

I hadn't caught that high mileage bit when I was doing my own little expense report review, that is **super** interesting. I did a dumb little timeline of their time there if anyone is interested:

Lt. Anthony Bertain sends Sergeant Brian Jackson and Detective Kyle Wallace to Detroit. They leave  to Sac airport at approx. 1pm(? This is per the memo.)

Depart Sacramento @ 4:20pm
Arrive Phoenix @ 7:05pm
Depart Phoenix @ 7:54pm
Arrive Detroit @  1:37am

Check in to hotel @ 3:15am 14600 Sheldon Road, Plymouth MI 48170

November 10th

7:26am Jackson and Wallace get breakfast @ Subway 30474 Milford Road New Hudson, MI 48165

5:14pm Jackson and Wallace get Dinner @ undetermined restaurant, (Ironwood Grill?)check says “4 checks, 1 customer?” and customer #3, they got an $11 blue cheese burger, side salad customer #1 got a Beef Brisket Plate, $14)


November 11th

8:22am Jackson, Wallace, leave hotel
8:45am Jackson, Wallace get Breakfast @ Cassel’s 43003 N. Seven Mile Road Northville, MI 48167
9:30am Jackson, Wallace get gas for rental
9:49am Jackson, Wallace drop off rental
Depart Detroit @ 11:05am
Arrive Phoenix @ 1:36pm
Panda Express Lunch @ 1:34
Depart Phoenix @ 2:32pm
Arrive Sacramento @ 3:35pm
Leave Sacto Parking @ 3:50pm

It looks like they definately did the lion's share of work there on the 10th. And I totally agree with you on their frugality! Bravo to them for not wasting taxpayer $$$. I'm gonna put this all together in my own head and see if anything else falls out. 😊

Here's the route that it appears they made, but I supposed they went to other places that weren't on the receipts, because its less than half of the 260 miles.  https://imgur.com/a/t4Ohl

I think you're correct, they went up to New Hudson (maybe further) to talk to the MM and get the sample which they drove down to Northville.

OTHER employees would just black it out, and I didn't have to care what it was, it wasn't on their expense sheet. 

Considering they usually kept the original, because it was spent on their credit card, copies would be made for each month, or type of expense, like having to divvy up a dinner between 3 accounts they talked about. Ugghhh. "|3||Moderator||0||False|0|||False|0|3|Michigan Man|46|

Then she called MM and told him to be on the next flight to the Motor City or there would be a divorce.  So SP got stood up in Woodland.  MM was in the air returning to his pissed off wife when she arrived.  Pissed off KP was figuring how to get the cops to bring his wife back home.

This is all just wild conjecture btw.  Nobody should take me seriously on this.

Edit Additional:

Didn't LE state that MM man was an acquaintance from SP's past.  So it's possible that KP knew her old acquaintance's name and possibly his wife and their phone number.  And MM had probably kept up with SP's marital and family status.

I agree with some posters about free speech being a right and one that we should cherish and defend.  That being said I truly believe along with the right to free speech, we are also taking on the responsibility not to use that to be a complete dick.  When we have offended one of our fellow posters, let us learn from the incident and ask ourselves if it is worth it offending someone we enjoy conversing with just to make a joke about financial well being or having a large mouth.  That's a personal preference, some people care more about offending people than others do. We have the right to be either way and speak either way. I rather enjoy having people I disagree with on here because it makes for more interesting conversation, and allows me to open my mind to alternative view points.  Again, we should have the right to say what we want to, but be aware of how it affects the people you like to have posting here, and if you are the one offended, just leave a note and tell someone why you think it was over the line.  Be up front, we are all adults here.

I think we can still have fun on this sub, and make fun of the more ridiculous aspects of this case without crossing any lines.  I hope instead of deleting or censoring posts, we can just address them with a response.  Anonymous reporting... come one anonopinis, I have personally written two open letters to you, neither of which were mean and none of you responded. You are welcome to have a voice here too, but don't do it this way, speak up. u/SquashKuash I saw popped up on this thread with suggestions and I hope you stick around to give your opinions.  If you would like more theories about actual abduction please lead the conversation, there are those of us who like to hear views other than our own.  

All and all I don't think mods are asking us to give up our free speech on this sub, more just asking us to realize how it affects them and the possibility of a shutdown.  I don't know which comments are being reported, so it's hard for me to make a judgement on who is behind it.  It does sound like the gang is here reading and reporting anything remotely 'mean' to the mods and that is not OK.  We can't let them dictate our conversation.  I hope we can move past this somehow an not lose any good commentors, I enjoy Teflon, Greeny, HappyN, Samasaras, Molls and all the Mods input here.  Didn't mean to leave anyone out, just named most of the people I've seen active on this thread today. Bezoar, Willy, alg, and the rest of ya too!

I think that sub has lost focus, and although entertaining, some of what we have been posting here lately may be crossing some lines which shouldn't be crossed.

There are mysteries in history which will never be solved.  The one I think of is the Kennedy Assassination.  Few believe Oswald acted alone and he was murdered before he could tell his story because Jack Ruby didn't want to put Jackie through a trial, but we will probably never know the truth.  The reason is that there are so many theories that the exasperated general public doesn't know what to believe.  A lot of these theories were propagated by the establishment to muddy the waters and they have.

I have noticed a lot of wild theories by new users over the last couple of weeks and am starting to believe that some are being planted here to muddy the waters and tank this sub and leave people forever scratching their heads as to what really happened here.

It doesn't help that neither LE or the people involved have come forward with many facts leaving the field open for wild speculation.  We just don't have enough facts presently and it's extremely frustrating.  As time goes on and we all seem to have a vested interest in communicating on this sub we come up with new daily posts and speculations.

I would urge the Ps or LE to come forward and put the facts out there for the good of themselves and all of us poor obsessives.

And I hope the mods will remind us if our posts or comments break the rules of cross lines which shouldn't be crossed and ask us to take it down or change it to live within the rules.  Of course we probably should think before posting so they don't have to think for us.

Making fun of The Gang doesn't seem bothersome to me at all. Public figures are mostly there because they chose to be and part of that notoriety is ridicule. I don't feel bad about that. 

However, we have users among us who may share qualities with The Gang. Maybe they are poor, have addictions, or share physical qualities with the people we are mocking. These people aren't public figures who signed up for anything. They are our friends who quietly suffer thinking ""Maybe I am actually a crappy person because of _____"".

Now personally I think anyone who is involved in any online community should have a thick skin. If there's a member of this sub who is hurt over a criticism of The Gang that strikes too close to home, I would tell them to take the jokes as they are: meant to criticize people we hold in contempt for reasons over and above what we are mocking them for. And then realize some randoms online aren't in any position to judge them. Then I'd give them a hug.

But I can't do that so I would urge people on this sub to remember their words can impact people other than just their intended targets. Make jokes, yes. But also be mindful of the messages you are sending to your Reddit friends.

When it comes to making fun of someone's looks, I haven't seen anything too crazy lately.  Pasting KPs face on Fred from Scooby Doo isn't ridicule in my opinion. Obviously, somebody got their feelings hurt, possibly one of the paps.
 

The mods were getting slammed with complaints so they asked us to cool it. Seems like a small thing to do in order to keep things working in this sub.


 If it was just one of ""us,"" a regular Reddit user,  who complained then you should have just had the decency to say something. If it was a Pap, well then I guess they've gotten what they wanted by causing trouble. **So, good job, you guys who want to throw a fit about the mods  just nicely asking us to cool it on one tiny issue.**


Asking them to step down (and with a new user name!) is silly and *dramatic*. Your ""right to have an opinion in SP's personality"" card could possibly be revoked. I'm sure they'd be fine with letting in an additional mod or 2, why don't you volunteer? Isn't doing something productive better than just complaining?

Papinis can very easily make it all go away by publicly confessing to the real story. Or even not confessing publicly, but at least telling it to the police and asking to keep it private, if they want to, like the family in San Diego did that we discussed here previously. Nobody would say anything bad about a family with real problems if they are honest about it. But they CHOOSE not to. For a freaking year!!! Instead they are fighting the only group of people who really wants to know the truth. What does it say about them??? It says that for them their lies (= keeping appearances) are more important that anything else - their children, their jobs, their livelihood. WOW!!

This sub is about discussing the disappearance of Sherri Papini.  That can be done without any name calling or put downs.  

I think the mods are more than fair with the way they run this sub.  I go on other Reddit subs and there are some very strict rules implemented in some of those subs- if you cross the line with disrespecting other users or disagreeing with the mods or go off the subject at all you are banned from those subs.  I have also been on reddit subs that have basically no rules or moderation and people are just outright nasty and don't stay on topic at all, to the point that there is no discussion going on, it's just trash talk about nothing of substance.  

The thing about this particular sub here is that the topic is specific, not like the sub about 'books', which would be a more general topic and there could be many different threads going on about many different types of books, etc.  In this SP sub people here are 'regulars' and have become more acquainted with each other, almost like a group of friends hanging out and chatting.  I cant speak for the mods, but I think they are trying hard to hold the sub together by keeping things on topic and to reduce the amount of offense to other users who participate in the discussions here, as well as anyone associated with this case.  

I think it would be beneficial to the future of this sub if everyone here would just keep discussions about this case going and to freely express themselves, but make an effort to be intentional about staying on topic and respecting each other.

I think they tried multiple times inserting new users and even VIs (Client being the most recent) to shift the narrative.

I'd like to see a reiteration of the rules address reporters -- specifically making it policy that serious threats of harassment and inciting violence (for example) are severe enough that require you to report under your username (and be kept confidential by the mods) so that follow-up to said complaints can be timely and addressed fairly.

It's really simple:  I believe in free speech.  I believe in truth.  I'm willing to put up with personal insults myself in order to have free speech and pursue truth in return.  

As I've noted, with Edgar Winter in particular, smashing her narcissistic idol is important to getting to the truth in this case.  This whole brouhaha is in part a reflection of the rage the narcissist feels when their false image is threatened.  It is the ONLY time you'll get the truth out of them.  

I'd support the principle even were there not a laudible goal in play, though.  You say what you like, I say what I like.  If I don't like what you say, I can ignore you, block you, or respond to you by saying what I like.  That's how Reddit's supposed to work.

Now, if you're a sensitive sort, staying away from those threads may be a good idea.

I've already said elsewhere that I was contacted privately by someone we all love and respect here.  This poster was sad because one of the needless attacks on SP was for a trait shared by the poster.  

Are we really no better than that?  Do we really not care if we say something that hurts one of our friends here?  

Something else I also said last night (looking at you, u/greeny_cat) is that when we had a poster here mocking the Gams for potentially not being able to buy food for their kids without financial aid (EBT cards)...I grew up poor.  I don't know if I needed to grow some balls about it, but I worked 2, 3, and even 4 part time jobs after I turned 18 to help support the family.  I bought my clothes at the second hand stores and washed, mended & ironed them to look nice at my management job.  Today I have a substantial amount of money, but that doesn't mean I've forgotten about children being food insecure.  And that's NOT a topic I find humorous, either.  I don't care if you make fun of my looks.  I don't care if you make fun of my personality.  The one thing that sets me off is crap like this, that people can't help, and insulting my intelligence.

We all have personal triggers.  We need to respect them, too.  "|12||||0||False|0|||False|0|12|Moderation Discussion & Town Hall Meeting|188|

Grow balls, people, or at least beg, borrow, or steal some!!! 

Plus, being ""poor, addicted, or blonde"" doesn't give you the right to demand that everybody should shut up about it. It's YOUR problem, not the problem of people talking about it (and maybe it's not a problem at all - just like with everything, it can be an advantage if you learn how to use it smartly). So, it's actually a problem of ""poor, addicted, or blonde""'s personality, not a problem of others. These are not ""protective classes"" nobody can criticize (and if they were, it would have been even funnier :-)))

And, finally, if Papini wanted to stop talk behind their back, they could have done it very easily - by calling a press-conference that allows hard questions from inquisitive journalists, and coming forward with a REAL story. In short, coming clean and telling the truth. I'm sure, nobody in this sub would have made fun of a real victim. But they stubbornly refuse to do it for year. I wonder why... ;-))) (wink-wink) So for now I believe it's fair game to make fun of liars and cheaters - just because they deserve it.

The mods make up random rules to appease those who complain the loudest. Who's to say what rule they'll think of next? You can be damned sure the anonapanini will try to further squash the conversation arounnd here, since the mods have already caved once. 

It's not that I'm insensitive. I've often thought people were rude about KPs job and salary (I think it's relevant to the case, because the point is that SP requires more from life, than KP can offer), but if someone feels hurt, because they have the same kind of job/salary, they can just say so. Make a post saying: ""Hey, I too make $xxx, and I live a perfectly good life with my family"", they might even change the original poster's mind about KPs job/salary. 

That's what the free exchange of ideas and opinion can do: change people's mind. The mods squashing free speech will only lead to continued myths and misunderstandings.

You make some good points here.  You would like to see more of a focus on discussing and finding the perpetrators.  I will say that many of the current posters on this sub are posting similar cases on this Sub...for discussion..and possible links to SP's abductors.  Just look at the recent couple in Redding that left a women abandoned half naked in the forest near Redding.  This case was posted and discussed in detail on this Sub.  So, this sub is not all Memes about SP and her family.   But what is frustrating about devoting more time to finding SP's abductors (after all they are dangerous if they can do this to SP), is why SCSO/LE and SP family members are not more energetic about finding these two female abductors.  If if anyone on this sub was excited about finding Sherri's abductors, their balloon was severely deflated with the revelation of MM and SP's communication with him.....just two days before she went missing.  I mean ......come on Sherri.  It looks like I might be the 1st one responding to you?  I hope that other users on this sub don't chase you away.

""There is no reason to vote on this issue; why would there be such vehement demand to ridicule a person? The fact that this decision is so heavily disputed says a lot about the posters here.""

So you're making it clear that you vehemently want to ridicule posters by calling them 'crazy,' 'dramatic and self-important,' and challenging how 'emotionally stable' others are just in this post. Previously you've also said 'this subreddit has seemingly been run by various students from Mountain View Middle School since its inception' and said of others that they are 'babbling' and posting 'drivel.' So yeah I agree with you that we don't need a vote, posters here should be able to ridicule public figures just as you've shown you're quite content with ridiculing, persecuting and harassing people here who aren't even public figures."|5||||0||False|0|||False|0|5|Moderation Discussion & Town Hall Meeting|188|

This is exactly where I feel like the mods are over modding here, almost every newspaper has cartoonist drawing politicians as fat elephants and criminals as well as people those cartoonist disagree with, it is an opinion expressed with more than just words.  

This is admittedly not a great example, but it amused me so I using it anyways.

http://www.businessinsider.com/al-franken-reaching-toward-woman-on-billboard-statement-by-street-artist-2017-11 

Opinions that are not inciting violance should only be moderated very cautiously even when some people find them distasteful.

Can I say that if SP was sleeping with other guys behind her husbands back I find it vile?  If so, can I say it with a picture?  Can I stand on the street and mime my displeasure?

If I do mime it on the street you are free to walk away, to not flip a quarter in my hat, to say your opinion, but you can't demand that everyone on the virtual street bows down to your view point.  I am referring to 'reports' as well as moderating in this regard since they get to choose what to do with this type of reporting.

I (mostly because of my job) am infamous with my family and friends for being very hard to offend. I was very poor growing up too but am not in the least bit offended by jokes about that. 99% of all topics are fine to joke about in my mind and I actually have to keep a lot to myself because I tend to make jokes that people find inappropriate. It's a defense mechanism I learned early on and it only got stronger working in the criminal justice system. We often say ""you have to laugh or else you'll cry"".

However,  I am a little older and don't have kids, though I want them. I am very, very sensitive about that. There have been a few situations where I randomly had to excuse myself because of people making jokes about sad cat ladies. Weird but true.

Anyways, all that rambling is to say that we all have things we are sensitive about. I don't want to insult or hurt my friends here, or want other people to do so.

I grew up without money too and wore second-hand clothes until I was about 16, then I started making my own clothes. Do I care about it now? No, because it doesn't matter, it's gone and forgotten. Growing without money actually gave me a lot of very useful life skills - what doesn't kill us, makes us stronger. There's no point in getting upset about the past decades after the fact, it's a waste of time and effort. You close the door on it and continue to move ahead, and don't let it bother you.

In this case, nobody can predict every individual person's sensitivity  to every topic, it's just not possible to read people's minds. If a person is upset, he may always express it in the thread, and explain why it's making him or her unhappy if they wish. But I believe it would be wrong to complain to moderators and demand the topic to be closed because other people may not find it offensive or even enjoy it. 

Individual person's sensitivities cannot dictate the whole discussion because it's not possible to make a social commentary without offending somebody, and the discussion cannot be centered around each and every individual.  Or we can start talking about the weather or cute kittens to make everybody happy, but I'm afraid, even then somebody may have an allergy! :-))

-----------------

Somehow off-topic, there's this hilarious comedy movie, called War on Everyone. It was made by a British guy, and it is so politically incorrect that the best scenes couldn't even make it into a trailer because it would be too offensive to show on TV. It literally makes fun of everybody - blacks, whites, Mexicans, fat, skinny, ugly, disabled, elderly, you name it. And it's so funny from the beginning to the end, I haven't laughed like this in years. If somebody would like to be REALLY offended, I would highly recommend this movie. :-)))"|3||||0||1512289643.0|0|||False|0|3|Moderation Discussion & Town Hall Meeting|188|

To the best of my knowledge, discussing public arrest records, publicly published mugshots, and missing person reports are not considered 'doxxing' topics.""

Releasing ANY non-public figure's information on Reddit is doxxing whether they're a Reddit user or not. You can't just go on Reddit and accuse someone not named in the media as being a kidnapper of Sherri Papini. In fact if you had actually be around and weren't just some newbie account, you'd know how this issue came up already and how it led to someone being harassed:

https://www.reddit.com/r/thepapinis/comments/5mxz9x/how_the_umbrella_of_suspicion_blog_story/

Then again, if you believe so firmly that it's not doxxing, go ahead and risk a permanent ban from all of Reddit as this isn't just a sub rule but a Reddit rule.

""Were you here during the incidents I am discussing? I am assuming you weren't, since you challenge my description of those events.""

Of course I was, but you're new, so you wouldn't know that. You're actually proving my point as I was neither confirming nor denying, but the accuracy doesn't matter as to whether or not it's ridiculing. Specifically what's been coming up is being able to call SP or others 'ugly,' which has been considered as ridicule even though any number of people would consider it a truthful statement and would probably love to vote it on it and whatnot. If what someone says they consider to be truthful is a defense against the charge or ridicule, etc. you're basically saying that people can say anything here against SP, etc., which I agree that people should be able to say what they believe is the truth about public figures.

""Even if I were guilty of the things you accused me of, it does not change the validity of my argument. At worst, I would be a hypocrite with a good point.""

No, you'd be a hypocrite with a bad point as SP, etc. are public figures while mods and users here are non-public figures.

""It is RIDICULE to insult anyone's appearance again and again""

Yet you've already established if someone believes it's the truth, it's not ridicule.

""It is PERSECUTION to demonize a woman you know nothing about for over a year on Reddit""

Yet it's not persecution to go and publicly accuse random people you know nothing about of having abducted of SP.

""It is HARASSMENT to threaten and attack this woman, her family and children""

Threatening to attack someone is a crime, which if you see criminal threats made, by all means report it to LE. Lock 'em up and throw away the key as far as I'm concerned.

""It is MUCH more helpful than sitting on Reddit all day, writing that SP has 'meth-ravaged teeth' or suggesting KP 'looks gay'.""

So why aren't you doing it? Other than complaining about others and then expecting them to do your bidding, why aren't you creating the threads you claim you want to see here? If you don't care enough to do it, you can't expect anyone else to either."|1||||0||False|0|||False|0|1|Moderation Discussion & Town Hall Meeting|188|

The degradation of her appearance from the Gkamour Shot/Photoshopped wedding photos to the more recent photos with their sallow skin, puffy eyes, brittle and thin hair, combined with her wasted frame is evidence of an unhealthy lifestyle, similar to that seen in severe addiction.  The crazy eyes speak for themselves.  

All of which is relevant to an investigation into the facts of the case, as opposed to the ridiculous nonsense cooked up by the narcissistic fabulist SP.  

KP apparently sets off gaydar all across the fruited plain but unless he was using the GFM cash to engage SP’s plastic surgeon for himself that’s of questionable relevance.

Were you aware that we weren’t allowed to ridicule Sherri Papini, especially those Giger Alien chompers of hers?  

That sounds like a new rule to me, but I may be the only one who didn’t get the memo.  

Apparently, we are allowed to mock Senor Droopy, Hostage Facilitator to our hearts’ content, and maybe even Jen Gamble’s Beach Body Bingo too, although I’m not sure how those are acceptable while ridiculing Po Man’s Barbie is not.

What I suspect is that Anonipini and a handful of snowflakes are anonymously working the mods in order to make this sub’s content more to their esoteric tastes. Why not let everyone have a go and handle it in broad daylight instead?

Here is my partial list of pet peeves which should be added to the Things We Shall Not Speak of Rule for content:

- Supermom
- Glamour Shot wedding photos
- Blanket babies
- the notion that a woman taking care of her children 3 days a week or less would never leave them
- Bethel Church
- Graeff parenting
- Signature blonde hair—-it’s a wig on top of a dye job
- Sex trafficking
- Trump
- Politics
- Weather
- Other cases
- Lisa Jeter
- Der Gambles
- Weed trimming
- Jogging

All of the above vex me for varying reasons; since I have the same right to serenity Anonipini and snowflakes have, I demand these be added to the list of Forbidden Speech.

The good thing is all of you have the same right to add your pet peeves.  Please reply with your additions so that the mods have a comprehensive list from the silent majority to consider. "|3||||1||False|0|||False|0|3|Moderation Discussion & Town Hall Meeting|188|

I think with this case it's been a bit difficult to broaden my scope because the details that have been publicly released have been very vague and narrow.  But I have always said that I am not completely convinced one way or the other, of truth or hoax, and I would overall like to see justice served in this case.  If SP really was abducted and hurt, well then let's tighten up the belts on our bathrobes, break out our fuzzy slippers and cups of coffee and gather up all the info we can get from all the sources we can obtain it from to help get her captors apprehended.  There's got to be more things, unknown to us, that are known to the people who are completely convinced her story is true.  But if SP's story is not true, then it would be only fair to those who have been invested in her story if she came forward with some kind of explanation- not that she owes anyone an explanation, we personally choose to be interested in her story and take part in these discussions, but it seems like it would be the right thing for her to do, does it not?  

In all sincerity, I would really like to know why you personally believe her story is true?  Is it simply because LE stated they believe her, or are there other things that make you positive that there are suspects to be searched for and identified?  I am not trying to debate this with you, I am honestly just seeking to know what makes you so sure.

Is there maybe some additional information from some source that can be obtained, other than what has been released through the media?  Something that would fill in some of the blanks that give a 'sleuth' more to go on?  Can some of the cryptic details that have been released through the media be explained in a way that support SP's narrative?  

It just seems like there are many inconsistencies- LE says they believe her story but then they release little bits of information that do not appear to support the fact they believe her and they leave a lot of room for people to think her disappearance was voluntary.  I think if there were more facts available to make SP's story more believable, there may be more people willing to make an effort to find her abductors.  

I am not trying to be contentious with you right now.  In all truthfulness I am trying to draw you out if you possibly have anything that would add to the puzzle that's been wracking our brains for a year.  I know you have said that you have no connection to this case, but it sounds like you may have more of a connection than you are letting on.  If you have anything that would help move our thoughts forward, I hope you will share it with us.  "|3||||0||1512374112.0|0|||False|0|3|Moderation Discussion & Town Hall Meeting|188|

I mean, same initials as a few other things/people (an airport, a girl who was murdered), but it could more likely be that she chose those letters randomly, or they're an acronym for something? Also, KP's old Pinterest is up. She follows him. I remember from long long ago looking at his Pinterest (I thought his, but maybe it's really SP's and she has two?) and seeing his username, which was easy to remember.

ETA: nothing interesting on his Pinterest. It really like more like things she would have pinned.

Eta: maybe she thought that by changing her name to ""Sarah"" (so different than her name! We'd never figure it out!) and choosing a completely random/nonsense username, she thought her Pinterest would not be found by people like us (who want to put 2 and 2 together and see if she leaves a clue there, even if about her issues/personality).

That she frequently changes it suggests no, but if she really didn't want anyone to see it, she would make the boards private or delete it! Plus, part of the nature of Pinterest is to share the pins with other people. For SP, I strongly suspect she enjoys being the center of attention still. 

Separately, I can only imagine that it would be very difficult to be a recluse (she is, right?), and to hide online all the time. At some point, isn't it going to come to a head? I would personally go nuts if I had to stay home all the time and had to be careful about such little things as what I posted online!

Do you get to keep your followers and who you’re following?  I peeped on the “33.” account and it only goes back a month.  You’d have to spend a good deal of time recreating all those pins, right? 

Anyway, I don’t think it’s a great indicator of anything anymore, because she probably knows people are scrutinizing it and probably keeps her public pins “clean”. I don’t see the point of trying to constantly stay abreast of the haters.

The case against SP is circumstantial - none of the pieces of the puzzle fit together and it produces what we have now. 

The biggest flag to me recently is LE's behavior. Dropping the info that she was talking to a man in Michigan, but not saying the type of relationship they had, etc. What is the point of releasing that? If SP was truly abducted, it doesn't help anyone to catch the Latinas. I'm not sure why they released it (especially in the cryptic manner they did), but there had to be some kind of reason.

I guess I would say the existence of the MM, the texting relationship.  It gives her some motive, he was in town right around that time, and most of all it proves what we've been saying all along, which is that she was being deceptive despite what her friends and family said.



By the way, in addition to KP's 'subhumans' remark, I watched a video the other day that was a friend of hers before the balloon release basically saying her doubters would go to hell.  Something like ""we'll all be judged at the gates, it's unfortunate they have chosen this path."" which was just such a bizarre and sick thing to say, a very vengeful attitude, yet still nobody is out seeking justice for SP.

&nbsp;

That leads me to my #2, which is that nobody close to her is seeking justice, they all seem to be just want to pretend none of this ever happened.  And of course her past and the unlikeliness of two women kidnapping and chaining someone up just to punch her for 22 days makes zero sense.

But then it became ‘she was kidnapped’ and then ‘taken from the area.’ With no ransom or proof. Then the blogs surfaced, the family and LE weren’t panicked in the least so pretty quickly after she took off I knew this was a hoax - whether intended that way at first or I think more likely Sherri leaving for another man and being coerced back somehow. 

No one ever thinks a grown ass adult is kidnapped and out of the area without evidence and true panic on the part of LE and the family. I saw none of that.

That is my #2 also - that never once has anyone even closely associated with Sherri ever shown the anger and desire for revenge towards the ""kidnappers"" that they have towards the completely random people who choose NOT to believe every word of their story.  The doubters are subhuman and will land in hell....

BUT no words nor actions that even once have appeared that they want the ""kidnappers"" to be caught or punished.  You are right - they want us all to believe that story but their actions prove they don't even believe those kidnappers even exist.

surely means she had no serious or threatening issues - or they would have made her stay for hydration, observation or further testing.

There has never been any independent or supporting evidence for the broken bones other than the single statement in the Keith interview which we know now had lots of falsehoods and exaggerations.  Remember- Keith said her wrists were bound with hose clamps but we now know they were not and we even saw her running without bound hands...and Keith also said that both women were in the SUV when **""THEY opened the door. ...and then pushed her"".**  Later they changed the story and said only one of the captors was there.

It makes me chuckle to think she completely ignored the advice.  But then again, I see the addiction that some older people have to FB and I think Loretta's got a bit of this.  If they don't read it on FB, it never happened. Maybe she thought changing her settings would restrict her in some way.

She could have been a casual user, but I don’t think she was an addict. I think it was an affair. 

And just for fun, I’m gonna repost the /u/marijuanapapinis comment: 

*“I want to remain anonymous and out of the drama going on in the family right now, but I wanted to comment on something I know about Keith and his wife,” the user wrote.*

*“Maybe it can shed some light on the case for you guys in some way. I’m hoping this gets solved too. I’m a family member of Sherri and Keith. Just to put this out there, Sherri isn’t a trimmer, as far as I know anyway (99 per cent sure not), but her and Keith use Kratom and smoke a lot of marijuana right now.*

*“Sherri had a really bad benzo addiction for a few years, I’m absolutely not sharing this as gossip but because I’m worried maybe she relapsed and was hanging around the wrong people and that could be the explanation behind the kidnapping.*

*“Sherri was getting a prescription for a drug called Diazepam when she started having panic attacks a few years ago. She went into the hospital and got off of it,” *

*”They stopped prescribing it to her and she’s relapsed a few times by buying other anti anxiety pills off the street. The last time this happened was 2014 or so, so she has been clean for a while. They say that they use pot and a drug called Kratom to keep her off the drugs.*

*“But as soon as this all happened it’s what a lot of us thought of. Maybe she made someone mad and they beat her up and kept her for a few weeks? I’m also not against thinking it’s a hoax for the victim assistance stipend.”*

Edit: The user /u/marijuanapapinis was a verified insider,  FWIW. *side-eye*

My little bit of fiction goes like this:

She has been texting hot and heavy with MM and has been planning to meet him on November 2 after his medical conference in SF.  MM has flown into Sacramento, driven to his conference, and is driving back to Woodland that afternoon.  She has arranged to have an old acquaintance drive her to Woodland where she plans to meet MM and spend the evening with him.   He plans to fly back from Sacramento to Detroit to his loving wife on Thursday morning.  She has told KP that she was planning a little getaway and he would have to pick up the kids that afternoon from day care and take care of them for a couple of days.  He told her that she needs to stay home and he expects her to be there when he gets home.

KP has been suspicious for a while and has been studying her phone bill online and noticing all of these 313 texts and phone calls.  He finds MM's home phone that afternoon and gives it a call getting MM's wife.  They discuss the situation and the fact that KP's wife and her husband are likely planning to meet that evening.

MM's wife is pissed and calls him and tells him that if he doesn't take the first flight back to Detroit that afternoon or evening there will be hell to pay.  MM changes his plan and flies directly home.

Meanwhile SP's Los Ubers driver has showed up and she meets him at the mailboxes with her little stashed go bag.  She left her car with the kid seats at the house so KP could use it to pick up the kids.  She leaves her family plan iPhone behind the mailboxes covered with some grass as she remembers the last minute that KP will track it and she doesn't want him to know where she is going.  She is enroute when MM changed plans and isn't aware that he won't be there to meet her.

When she gets to Woodland it takes her a couple of hours to finally figure out that MM has chickened out and flown home.  She might have stayed at the motel which they had already booked for that night or looked up some old acquaintances in the area. 

Meanwhile KP comes home and is pissed that she is not there and has defied him.  He runs his phone tracking app and, to his surprise, the phone is just down the street.  He has to take her car to pick up the kids anyway so he gets in her car and tracks the phone down to the mailboxes.  He sits there scratching his head for a minute and then he decides to let the cops find his wife.  Of course they won't believe that she was ""grabbed"" but, afterall, she did abandon her phone and not pick up the kids from daycare.

The next day SP finds out that she has already hit the news and she decides to stay with her old acquaintances for a while and teach KP a lesson.  Alternately she is too embarrassed to come crawling home at the moment and needs time to figure it out.

The SCSO hits on her plans to meet MM after reading her texts and thinks either he might have hidden her or killed her when he was in town or she went back to Detroit with him so they dispatch 2 of their finest to the motor city.

She finally gets in contact with KP and tells him that she will be home for Thanksgiving if certain conditions are met.  A certain member of the A-team with deep Woodland/Yolo connections brings cash and arranges the Thanksgiving miracle.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

And then I have scenario 2 which is the grand conspiracy ""Project Taken II"" scheme.  I think either would make a good screenplay:)

Kratom is actually a widely used alternative to help opiate, benzo, and alcohol addicts kick their drug of choice. Chemically it works something like an opioid but with less of a ""high"" and more moderate physical dependance. I should clarify that it has never been something that would be prescribed by a doctor, more of an herbal, self help kind of remedy.

I find it totally believable that Sherri could have been using kratom for that purpose. It's also possible for kratom use to trigger relapse in an addict who has been sober.

As with all narcissists, she relies upon sources of narcissistic supply to feed her idealized image of herself.  Like all narcissists, she becomes enraged when this supply is shut off.

I contend that getting to the bottom of this case requires triggering narcissistic rage on her part, whereupon the mask will drop and the truth will out.  This requires smashing the idols she (and others enabling her) have built.  

Ridicule is a powerful idol-smasher.  The response the mods (and some of us purveyors of said ridicule) are getting is simply a sign of the effectiveness of this tactic.  As the military axiom has it, “Taking flak means you’re over the target.”

If political correctness is more important to this community than getting to the truth—-and you’d better believe the truth will be uglier even than a goggle-eyed tweaker after a 3 week meth bender—then it’s time for more folks than Molls to move on.

How about a teensy, weensy bit of outrage for those who perpetrated this fraud and ripped off good-hearted people in order to have a fling, get high, or buy a truck?

She's an apparent racist, may have defrauded those who donated to her GoFundMe, etc. The list never ends.

Like it or lump it, that’s a fact.

Recall the Lacey Peterson case if you want to understand the role narcissistic rage plays here; Scott Peterson is probably sonebody you’d have less objection to ridiculing.

I’m also unaware of the Reddit rule which defines acceptable methods of ridicule excluding personal appearance (in which case people mocking Trump’s Oompah Loompah pigmentation should be getting some mod wrath).

This is sounding a bit like one mod laying down the hammer over a pet peeve, which I hope isn’t true.  

Molls did the banner as you probably know because my offerings were rejected as being too mocking of the received Papini narrative, the mods preferring a more evenhanded approach.

Will it always be squeaky clean? No.

We live in America, democracy is dirty, our voices count if we want it to, and our opinions all have a place even if the morality and ethics behind the opinion are lacking.

It’s called freedom, and unless we are breaking the law (libel, etc), then the terms of service for the sub should should allow for intelligent, sometimes dirty, discourse.

Without this, it’s simple censorship and the narrative will no longer be true and organic, it will be synthetic and managed. Just like SP.

If I were managing a sub dedicated to Scott Peterson, I still wouldn't see a reason to allow posts that only had the substance of ""Scott Peterson is ugly!"" I just don't see how it contributes to the conversation.  Scott Peterson is an awful person, but whether he's ugly or not, it doesn't add or detract from the evilness of his character. However, Scott Peterson (with the same initials as Sherri Papini, I just realized) did seem to think he was hot sh##. If someone wanted to use Scott Peterson's looks (or how he viewed himself) to explain a bigger argument,  that would be much more interesting. 

There's three mods, we came to the conclusion together. No hammer is really being laid down. I just don't see why it's a problem to not post that people are ugly. 

Your pictures were fine. We told you that we'd incorporate them into the subreddit somehow, didn't we? They were a little too pro-hoax to be in the banner. Nothing wrong with the pictures though, and I appreciate how well-made they were. The banner is the first thing people see, so we just want it to be a balanced perspective of the case. 

I completely agree with you on that last point.

“Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.

Being annoying, vote brigading, or participating in a heated argument is not harassment, but following an individual or group of users, online or off, to the point where they no longer feel that it's safe to post online or are in fear of their real life safety is.”

Why, this sounds a lot more like the folks bitching to the Mods than it does any of us, doesn’t it?  

How has posting my Edgar Winter album cover caused anyone to fear for their safety?  I for one haven’t followed anyone online or off.  More essentialy, this rule says nothing about SP’s looking nothing at all like a teenager but quite remarkably like an albino funk rock genius of the 70s.   Aren’t you guys reaching a bit here?

How about a rule requiring all posts not clearly tied to discussion of the case being flared Off Topic instead?  That way such things could be more easily ignored by the touchy.  

Otherwise this looks a lot like the sort of thing this particular sub was created in response to following all the drama at The Other One and The One Before the Other One.

Moreso regarding the Gambles, honestly. The vast majority of readers are doing everything fine. There's a few people we've had issues with. 

Religion, mental health, drug addiction, sexual behavior, family relationships, employment, politics, and intelligence can be (heavily) related to the disappearance. Sherri Papini or Jen Gamble or Sherri's cat being ugly doesn't. (Unless you're making a specific point - like that SP looked younger or older than her age, her teeth being drug-damaged, SOMETHING that isn't just  a straight insult and actually has to do with an argument regarding the case.) 

I'll sit down to construct a clearer rule later today with the other mods. As well as I can state it - don't post that anyone is ugly. Don't ridicule people. The size of someone's nose or how big their feet are or whatever (usually) has nothing to do with the case. 

I've kept this post up because it's a protest to the new rule. But saying SP looks like Edgar Winter - okay. I don't get how that relates to the case. It just seems like an insult to me. Humor is welcome, but I don't think it should be mindlessly insulting someone's appearance for the heck of it.

You mods have a tough job to do!  Continually getting notifications because of some noobs (who I believe are mostly plants) would get more than a little annoying.  Heck you might be lying around in your robes, trying to even up your brows and swill some mocha lattes, and BZZZZT, there goes that damn button again!

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:  If you're truly offended by a particular user, block/hide them!  It's easy!  Do it!  Believe me, there've been a couple of people in this sub (and others) that I've had the pleasure of blocking.  Go for it.

I don't want to see this sub shut down over misuse, and those of you who are in it for the long term don't either, I know.  There are a few times comments have stepped over the line.  I've had 3 or 4 total warnings over the course of the last eleven months in this sub.  I've tried to accept the warnings in a gracious manner, treating the mods like I'd want to be treated.  We all should act that way!

PRIVATELY I've been contacted by some very wonderful members of our community who are hurt by criticisms made regarding looks and health issues.   We've said and done some things that have really made our buddies feel badly.  Perhaps they share characteristics with SP and Co.  Heck, maybe they've had to use EBT to feed their children.  I grew up very poor, and ate a lot of donated commodities.  That was the program back in the 60s, before food stamps or EBT accounts.  How do you think cruel comments like that make me feel?  Even though I'm fairly well off today, I felt sad and ashamed.  In 1980, when I was 22, I was the only person in my family of 7 who was employed.  That'll catch your attention!  

So in conclusion, if you can't abide by these very few guidelines the mods have tasked us with following, I guess I don't want you here anymore.  I have to believe most of us never considered how a joke or offhand comment could hurt someone's feelings.  

If I ever hurt any of you, I apologize.  Now let's try to remember the people behind the user names, okay, gang?   I hope we're still friends after you read all this.   Thank you.  Hugs!  "|11||||0||False|0|||False|0|11|A Reiteration of the Rules|25|

We're not snowflakes. We won't melt under the realization that They do not think as We do.  

I spent part of my childhood eating government cheese and the larger portion of it wearing hand-me-down clothes from my cousins (who unfortunately were 8 years older, meaning lots of bell-bottoms being worn in the 80s). Want to wax poetic regarding the trailer park status of CamGam and company?  Fine by me.

I have a hairline receding faster than the tide before a tsunami and a pigmentation that can be spotted on clear days from the international space station.  Care to have a go at Casper the Friendly Ghost jokes?  I'm down.

The purpose of this sub is to discuss and try to get to the truth of this case.  It's a long, hard slog which is leavened occasionally by humor.  Moreover, the hoaxsters involved include one very obvious narcissist who a) cannot help but read the sub and b) vents narcisstic rage in various ways when ridiculed, no matter how obliquely.  If the purpose of this sub is as noted above, that is a GOOD thing.  It means every time one of their idols is smashed little bits of truth get scattered. Narcissists are Truth Pinatas---you will only get the truth from them when they're bashed.

To people who've had charmed lives and never dealt with narcissists, this bashing---we experts call it ""cutting off narcissistic supply"" since we've read the books---appears cruel, ugly, and juvenile.  That cannot be avoided; they have no idea how narcissists operate.  We ask that they keep an eye instead on what happens afterward, as the narcissist vents their rage in thread and to the mods.  Look for this pattern:

a. Immediate escalation out of all proportion to the affront;
b. Orgy of downvotes;
c. Complaint to the moderator;
d. Deletion of account.

As we used to say in the AF, ""If you're taking flak, you're over the target.""

Moreover, in this particular case personal appearance is important.  There's the matter of the Glamour Shots used to get police and media focus on this hoax, to the tragic exclusion of an actual missing woman (now feared dead).  There's the claim that Sherri Papini was targeted by sex traffickers who mistook her for a teenaged girl---something no one would do even with the Photoshopped woman in the wedding album.  There's the stark degradation in her appearance over the years since her wedding, indicative of some major health issues if not addiction. There's her claims of being the next Bruce Lee in her racist blog and in her statements to the police.  There's the matter of her ""signature long, blonde hair"" which has quite different impact if it were natural or a wig.  There's even her augmented chest, with a theory that she'd had an enhancement very close to the date she went missing, which would argue against taking up running as a postoperative therapy.   So much is tied up in appearance---and now it's off limits?

I must protest this rule, which appears arbitrary, capricious, and has already demonstrated a tendency toward selective enforcement.  Why is Sherri Papini to be protected but not Keith, who to my eye resembles nothing so much as Chris Kattan's Mango character.  Why not CamGam, whose Senor Droopy countenance has met with so much mockery?  JenGam's appearance has been remarked upon repeatedly, in no small part to the Beach Body nonsense she embraces.  Are these verboten too?

The original crew left WS because they didn't want to be told what they couldn't discuss.  Many of us left The Other Sub for similar reasons, though honestly that was a less oppressive situation than the new rules here portend.  

This is a discussion sub being derailed by those (particularly Anonipini) who want to quash discussion.  Shall we let them?  If so, what's the point?

Modding's a tough job.  I take no issue with our mods---I'd just like them to step back from the precipice of politically-correct censorship here, before the bulk of us wind up having to come up with yet another name for a sub following this case.  It's silly to do the same dance again and again.

We aren't snowflakes.  If we don't care for a particular thread or comment, as HappyNetty notes, block the user or ignore the content. If you're a member of The League of the Perpetually Offended, perhaps you should let your dues lapse and try uninhibited discussion for a change.  

And if you want to reply to each and every one of my posts with ""You hydrocephalic, Goodwill-trousered albino...."", why, that's the price I'm personally willing to pay for free speech. 

Vote No on The Ugly Duckling Rule.  We're not going to call somebody a beautiful swan because the Anonipini demand it.

Please guys, just remember we are a little community here. There are many differing opinions, perspectives, and personalities behind these screennames. Just like in the outside world, we might occasionally bicker. And that's OK. The mods aren't going to step in every time people have a difference of opinion that gets a little tense for a moment. Most of these things generally de-escalate in 2 or less comments. We expect that you are adults who can put an internet spat into context and move on quickly. I guess my personal opinion is if you find yourself in a disagreement with another redditor, have a voice for yourself, but also consider, does this matter, can I just brush this off and walk away, and how is my response going to impact the tension level and health of the overall sub. 

With regards to criticism written of people outside the sub, I'd suggest not going beyond critiquing things that are controllable. If it's a choice made, I think it's fair to have an opinion. For example, hair extensions. It's probably fair to express the opinion that fake hair might be less attractive than a shorter more natural look.  But something out of her control, I'd probably only discuss if I thought it related, and I'd be sure not to be mean. For example, a discussion of weight pre and post abduction is fine in context, but actual criticism is not. 

Tone and context are so very import. People will tell you to write comments as though you are speaking in person to your subject. That's good advice. But, the advice I'd give you is maybe more self serving. I'd suggest that you treat people well for your own benefit. Think about what you are writing. Are you going to come back and cringe over this comment in the future? What about your mother, your significant other, your child? Would they know this is your writing? Would the be horrified? (LOL) The internet has a way of changing our personalities. It makes words seem like they are attacking you personally even when they aren't. It might make you bolder and less inclined to censor yourself of step away from a growingly heated situation. But the answer to all of this is remember who you are. Remember your own humanity and think how your words reflect upon you. Do they show you in a good or bad light?

Anyway, just my really long and unedited 2 cents. (It's also me speaking as just another redditor who has put my foot in my mouth more than once right along side you guys.) 


Please have a great weekend, and redditor or Papini supporter, remember that this is just a tiny little nook in the internet with some people and opinions. Be calm and carry on? Please? ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ"|5||Moderator||0||False|0|||False|0|5|A Reiteration of the Rules|25|

We had barrage of comments reported to us for various reasons. A few were reported issues that were appropriate for address and remove comments that broke rules. But many were opinions of dislike of a photo, a comment, a user. They weren't things that broke any rule. Being that they were reported anonymously, we had no other way to reply but publicly. 

Basically as u/abracatada says at the beginning, nothing crazy happened. The world isn't falling apart. The state of the union is strong. Etc. We tried to remind people earlier on the sub what the report button is used for and what it is not used for. And we tried to remind people that if they choose to report anonymously, they may not see how we dealt with their report or get an explanation why we did or didn't take the action they desired. 

Is the rule arbitrary? No. Is it subjective? Yes. It's a matter of personal opinion where the line between discussing the case and looking evidence is drawn from overly harsh criticism. The line is even more subjective between what is a little humor or what is mean. Or even a harmless jab at an involved party to try to get a reaction. Is that fair? Sure, we are adults, and so are the parties in the case. The difference to me is if the comments are truly mean, if they are irrelevant, if they serve no purpose, if they are classless and universally distasteful, then they are likely breaking rules. 

We do our best as mods. We offer our own perspectives with eachother when we make decisions. But, we really do try to err on the side of less visibility and fairly limited censorship. We don't want to be police. It's nearly impossible to be part of the community while aggressively policing it. We'd rather just be oiling the system and replacing an occasional part that breaks.

The rule is almost completely arbitrary by your own definition of extreme subjectivity, as is “fairly limited censorship.”  

Why not establish a non-arbitrary standard instead?

Such as:

“Comments/posts which consist of nothing more than ridicule of another poster’s appearance, religion, political persuasion, or command of the English language are subject to immediate deletion.”    That would be reasonable enough to me. 

Of course, the real aim of the griping is to protect Dear Sherri, which makes it unacceptable to the Anonipini.

You’ll need to choose between fostering open discussion (which the vast majority of us want) or appeasing those who want no discussion save the aping of Nicole Wool’s talking points.  Past history around here points the way forward."|6||||0||False|0|||False|0|6|A Reiteration of the Rules|25|

Otherwise, if you'd like the mods to be able to address your concerns and have a discussion, modmail is the best solution.

We've set rules that give the sub standards of appropriate behavior. It's really more of a continuum than a yes vs no. You should understand that. We weight the value of the comment negative or positive to the healthy function of the sub and we take the action we deem appropriate.

You example verbiage might be fine except I would personally probably word it with ""consist substantially of."" Yes, substantially is a bit arbitrary, but if somebody writes a paragraph of ridicule and an addition single unrelated cohesive thought, it's not appropriate. Also, it's not deletion, it's removal. In the example I just gave, the person would be allowed to edit and have their comment reinstated.

Mods are currently considering the best way to clarify and set objective standards. But even though I'm a broken record, I'll say, nothing has changed substantially.

And this whole thing wasn't as much about bullying of Sherri or Gambles. It was mostly complaints about interpersonal Reddit users in slightly heated discussions. And again, the complaints were about inaction rather than action. 

I'm talking until I'm blue. I'm just going to direct you to the town hall open discussion. If you guys want to hash out what you think is good, bad, needs to be discussed or voted on, I'd like you to have a single place. That way it can all get said and fixed or explained or whatever.

The Anonipini make regular use of the downvote (often in violation of Reddit rules, btw). That should be more than sufficient.  Letting them dictate content guidelines is a bit much, though.

If you don’t intend to censor, then don’t censor.  You don’t need any new rules for that and won’t get flak from anyone who isn’t just trying to shut discussion down anyway.  

I’ve seen this movie twice before here; the ending sucked both times we went down such paths, whether or not the mods wanted to go there.  

Just don’t do it.  Folks’ll find something else to gripe about when working the mods doesn’t prove effective.

You told me you’d include those, sure——AFTER you told me you didn’t find them appropriate for a banner because you wanted a more “evenhanded” approach to attract people who believe Sherri Papini’s story.  I suggested Molls because she’s more subtle, more talented, and (I thought) more tolerant of such a position than I am. Beat a useless argument, thought I. 

The real issue is you guys seem overly sensitive to whining about content which is in no way in violation of Reddit rules.  If people don’t like it, they can always:

-  not read it
- create their own content to combat it
- if they feel it doesn’t contribute to the discussion, downvote it

No need for any kerfuffle at all.  

If further guidelines are needed locally, I simply asked they be clearly written and not arbitrary.  I don’t think that’s an unreasonable position, but I guess we’ll see.

She admitted to hearing a gun shot while in captivity, this may be an element of truth slipping out, possibly as a way to get ahead of the story should it be figured out later.

If they figure out where she was and determine a real shooting took place, and maybe someone did die (but not as described or discussed yet), then it would explain SPs and the family’s desperation to go the extra mile to cover it up.

If I was the SCSO, I’d want to verify whether a truly vicious crime is being covered up, as it sounds like there are ‘signals’ after the return that indicate something very real actually went down. 

It’s possible the family is still unaware SP may have had to kill to escape, maybe the cops know and are closing in finally.

Either she killed somebody or she was escorting, is my guess, both powerful reasons to keep quiet and lie for one another.

Everyone keeps saying she is a crazy narcissist, which she could be, but that isn’t reason enough for me to explain the family’s, SPs, KPs, and the police’s behavior after she came back.

It’s more likely to me there is a series of crimes, which includes a hoax element, but may have more serious crimes wrapped in.

Whatever happened, it’s obvious her inner circle is attempting to proactively maintain her ‘victimhood’, which is a big signal.

The question is whether SCSO and the FBI are truly investigating, as an SP family member works as part of Animal Control, a department of the SCSO. My belief is they are, and may have enough to start wedging SP and KP, which will likely end with an arrest warrant of some kind (probably served to KP, who will then turn on SP since he knows she is the one who caused it all)."|6||||0||False|0|||False|0|6|No One Was Killed As a Result of this SP 'Disappearance'.|38|

Thanks to the loudly squeaking-wheels of the minority, the entire sub faces constant threat of shut down at every turn, so mods have their hands forced,  to wag down at us, and thereby parent us, and our words, thoughts, jokes, etc....it goes on and on. 

We don't have a local, ""Comedy Store"" to work out our humor before we play ""The Garden"" for the big Netflix gig. We say things, we make jokes, we get caught up in emotional and heated discussions, and I just can't reason it out in my head why people insist on NOT just letting it go. 

One thing I will say about Molls, she posted her mind, and whether you liked it or not, she kept the comments she made, UP on the sub. She never came in here, making comments insulting this sub, and the others in it, just to turn around and delete it a few minutes/days/months later like a coward. She stood by what she said  and she contributed a helluvalot more good than bad, and that is 1000x better than what this sub will become when we give in to parenting each other.

As far as censorship goes, and I really don't know what's happening with this sub in particular, I think people, in general, on the internet, need to be careful, or mindful, of what they say. People state things as if they are fact, when it's an opinion. If a person states something, they need to back it up with facts. Regardless of anyone's personal opinion of SP, she is a mother, a wife, a daughter, sister, a human being. There have been people on this sub stating she's a meth head, for instance. A person can't just slander/libel another without ramifications (at times). That's not censorship. 

I know you know this, and what I'm saying isnt even about Molls. I could be way off base because I don't know this situation first hand, but it's what came to mind when I read this.

I thought there really was no point in letting the press ask any questions after she made her statement because she did not answer most of them, and the few questions she did comment on were pointless because she did not even directly answer the questions being asked of her.  

But then again I am guessing that everyone involved was being told by LE not to say too much because they could compromise the investigation.  And maybe she did not have many answers if Sherri was telling them she didn't remember anything.  

I will say that I wasn't thinking too highly of the family for putting a heavily pregnant woman in front of the cameras to face all that, especially after she had just gone through a very stressful 3 weeks of wondering where her sister was.  I'm not sure why someone else- family or friend or chosen spokesperson- couldn't have made the same evasive statements instead.  

As to why she didn't answer if SP worked, I think it could be: 

a) the daycare or other entity would have found out. If she was claiming to be employed there could have been consequences to admit that she did not work, or visa versa if she was claiming to be unemployed and receiving some kind of benefit that would have been affected if she did work.  b) she may have been employed doing something that they did not want to be exposed.  c) it would have maybe sounded awkward if SK said ""Well, she sells secondhand stuff in an online marketplace for a little extra income or d) maybe SK really didn't know if SP was employed (which is unlikely but I guess you never know.)  

I also got the impression that that was the point in this whole case where the family was trying to tell the public ""Ok, we wanted the spotlight and the attention on SP and on our situation for the last few weeks but now she's back home so now you can leave us alone and don't ask us any questions.""

Out of all the people involved I think I felt sorry most for Sheila."|10||||0||False|0|||False|0|10|SP's Sister's Press Conference|15|https://i.redditmedia.com/6vflXecxNkuIBBo9Ypd07vbQ6KdQt_So8hopuBZVWvE.jpg?s=13163c1d040a2305ced8a81567627e74

He was very vocal on SM, commenting and defending SP. but I don’t recall him making comments or doing any interviews on TV. Strange. Maybe they felt it was best for a blood family member to lead the way, and since SPs parents seemed uninterested in playing along, Sheila had to step up. |6||||0||False|0|||False|0|6|SP's Sister's Press Conference|15|https://i.redditmedia.com/6vflXecxNkuIBBo9Ypd07vbQ6KdQt_So8hopuBZVWvE.jpg?s=13163c1d040a2305ced8a81567627e74

I also thought maybe she was spotted 'jogging' several times because she was working up the nerve or just trying to be seen.  I've been thinking a lot about the MMs role in this and I'm pretty convinced he left town early because he did meet up with SP and she was freaking him out or he got cold feet about meeting up with her.


But just because LE says there's no evidence they met up doesn't mean they never did.  They've been very evasive and maybe even fibbed a bit in the past.  I feel like they said there was nothing on the church tapes (maybe it was 'not much to see or something like that) and they made it sound like they knew what the brand said, that it was a message, then later said they didn't know what it said.  So the point is, we don't know which days the MM was in CA or if they really did meet. They said something along the lines of ""they had planned to meet days prior..."" and ""no indication that they met up."" and ""he was not responsible for her disappearance"" not ""they did not meet up"" and nothing about the details of the message between them while he was in CA.  

I 100% believe that her disappearance was sparked by his visit to CA in some way or another."|8||||0||False|0|||False|0|8|My Final Theory for 2017|24|

The problem with that though is I don't exactly see her returning it to the rental lot once she got down there.

But yeah, maybe with a fresh hairdo and grey sweats (maybe the top half was a hoodie?) she could have gone unrecognized via bus or multiple busses.

Karma's a bitch, here on Reddit and in the real world.  If any of you little chickens are messing with our sub, and caused Molls to delete her account, your ""rewards"" are coming for you.  They won't be pretty gold glitter and neon-colored feathers blowing out of the air ducts either.  

Hide and watch-cause I will.  I guarantee that we all reap what we sow...and that includes people who involve themselves in a conspiracy to defraud their community of time, money and Law Enforcement resources that could have been used to help real victims.  It includes anyone who defrauds their state's victims fund.  It includes folks who obtain Go Fund Me donations by deceit.  

Think about who you're working for, and what you're working for.  Then ask yourself if you'll feel good about it in a year's time.  Can you tell your mother what you're doing?  Can you tell your kids?  

I'm interested in the truth.  When Sherri first disappeared, I was  sure her husband had harmed her.  Thankfully, I was wrong.  After her return, the pieces of the puzzle never seemed to add up.  That's why I continue to follow this case.  Why are you all here?"|11||||0||False|0|||False|0|11|Some things that need to be addressed|75|

For the record I do think saying anything about a person's physical appearance is totally out of line and can be very hurtful as well as extremely damaging to anybody, especially to someone who likely needs a lot of help, whether you believe her story is true or not true, and I wont join in on callousness or laugh at it.

Saying she doesn't look like a teenager is also allowed. Keep it related to case discussion and we have no problem. Insulting her appearance for no reason isn't allowed.

I think KP's reaction (911 call) coupled with their self protection pinterest boards and with accounts from Sherri's past (The woman who SP almost got fired after SP had a meltdown at her office when the woman was 20mins late, and racist blog posts, 'cultural differences' pinterest board) and not to mention KP using the 'subhuman' term, it sounds like they could have easily pissed someone off.  I think whatever was done to piss off the 'kidnappers' must be so bad, so shady or illegal that those around her are willing to cover for her (like the insiders who say 'if we knew all the facts' we would understand), her parents reaction of anger vs worry also lends itself to this theory.  The pathetic description of the kidnappers also makes me think that she was told to describe them this way and was threatened to not say a peep about what happened. 

The weirdest thing about this scenario is that they stayed in the same house.  If she was really kidnapped near the driveway, by someone she wronged and is under some sort of threat to never say a word and stick to the Latina story, I can't believe they would stick around!

I don't know, u/CornerGasBrent.  This would be an awfully risky trick to pull in bankruptcy proceedings, NOT that hiding assets isn't done every day.  Back in the lean years of Nettyhood, I learned a bit about this so was able to hide a tiny bit of my own (from abusive soon to be ex) while looking for HIS hidden assets.   However, we weren't trying to defraud our Uncle Sam. 

RRIII would have to be a fairly sharp guy to amass millions.  And declaring bankruptcy doesn't necessarily spell doom for the rest of a person's life, either.  Heck I had a BIL declare twice!  He came out of it smelling like a rose, the scum bucket.  

This is an interesting theory, but it wouldn't be in my Top 3. RRIII would have to be pretty stupid to hitch his wagon to these clowns.  I know we all chuckle about him; still rate him as fairly intelligent.

I know with certainty MF and wife moved to Redding in 2009/2010 so that she could attend BSSM. They had moved to Omaha by the time SP was kidnapped. However, MF's Bethel-centric consulting firm is based in Redding and I believe is still operating there. (It was in the Redding Chamber of Commerce, along with Jeter's company in at least 2015, maybe later). They seem to be *very* wealthy and have multiple homes and vacation homes. MF appears to have traveled for work frequently and it would not surprise me at all if he regularly flies into Redding. 

(Interesting too because it could explain why this ""non-local"" billionaire would even care about the SP saga. Their whole thing has been helping Redding since they first moved there in 2010. It seems very much like a pet project for them. He is also *very* well-connected to higher-ups in Redding like Missy MacArthur, etc.)"|5||||0||False|0|||False|0|5|What Is To Gain From Outing the AD?|18|

Go to ""preferences"" in the upper right corner by your user ID.  Go down to ""display options"".  Uncheck the box that says ""allow subreddits to show me custom themes"".  Be sure to press the ""save options"" box ALL the way down on the lower left side.

I did this a LONG time ago, because the basic view is much easier for me to read.  It's very clear and has few distractions.  Someone like me doesn't need any more distractions, LOL.

She claims to be an insider and comes on to challenge everyone with an opinion, then proceeds to say she doesn't know Sherri, she doesn't know what Sherri has said and the maximum she was willing to say about Sherri was ""I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt"".

The rest of the entire discussion seems to center on the conclusion that this was all aboot sex-trafficking - which I think we can now safely say is not true.

So why was Jen Gamble so sure it was all about sex-trafficking or drugs when now that has to be about as far down on the list of possibilities as being abducted by aliens in a UFO.

Lastly - in almost every answer she gives - she repeats that same sociopathic BS about how she is such a victim and has suffered such tragedy & unfairness but has overcome in tremendous fashion to be an outstanding person - caring and loving - just the same stuff she still peddles on her blog - that apparently some people are just gullible enough to fall for."|9||||0||False|0|||False|0|9|Revisiting the JenGam pseudo-AMA|28|

I truly don’t think CG was involved in any way other than the weird ass hostage negotiation ordeal.  

I don’t think the gambles are bad people. A little delusional maybe, but not malicious. I think JG came here to defend her family, and I’d probably do the same. I am sure they regret getting involved in this, whether they admit it or not. I personally don’t believe the “reverse ransom” had anything to do with the thanksgiving miracle, but maybe they do. Idk 

I am curious how JG feels after the recent updates from LE.  JG stated many times that she believed the Papinis weren’t talking or publicly condemning the two Latinas because LE told them not to talk.  Well, now LE has given the green light, but it’s crickets.

I think she was hung up on sex trafficking because that would reinforce CamGam's relevance to the situation. I wonder if she would *still* try to sell us that idea now?

I honestly don't even see how anyone could think he really is some kind of hostage negotiator/kidnapping expert/whatever else they claim. Those aren't skills that are had by non-law enforcement people. This is a dude who spent 3 years as an Air Force driver (no shame there!) and then...nothing?  Some vague references to on-the-job training with some secretive company? OKAYYYYY.

He's not a retired FBI/CIA agent, or even a local cop. (I actually knew a  small-city cop who was the designated ""hostage negotiator"" for the local police. He had to do training with the FBI which cost the city a lot of money so I know Cammy didn't fork out to do the same training for fun).  CamGam has NO law enforcement training.

Next thing I know, one of the mods messaged me and said they were thinking of doing a well thought out pre-ama so they could get a nice organized record together to reference, and to get all of the basic questions out of the way so when the real AMA came along everyone could ask more details from the pre-ama or any other questions.

I wasn't real familiar with reddit culture at the time and had no idea it would cause such a controversy, but it was a bloodbath haha.

Almost as soon as we sat down at the table, instead of a meal, we were served up a 2 hour pitch for a financial life coaching program and an opportunity to ""buy into the business.""  When they finally took a breath we politely declined, rounded up the kids and hightailed it out of there.  We weren't actually disgusted or anything but we were amazed and saddened at how sold in these people were to what they were talking about.  I could tell I made them a bit uncomfortable cause I was asking some very specific questions here and there about how much they actually earn from what they were doing and they were very clever in dodging the questions.

But it sounds like Getfit21 is a goner so JG must be saddled with tons of MILKshakes and DVDs as that's how MLMs work - sucker the suckas to load up on shitty over priced merchandise to reach or maintain certain level.

arlier this year, I made another decision that scared me to death again. I walked away from a company that I was extremely successful in. I was in the top 250 of that company of 500,000 coaches. Walking away from the income that allowed my husband to not have to work out of town anymore. A lot of people said I was crazy.
.

Maybe. But, I don’t think so. You see I knew there was more and I wanted more for my clients. I wanted more for me and I was being held back. 2 seconds of courage and I jumped again. Absolutely terrified.

Yes! From what my family in the area says, lots of tweakers in the area and they're always stealing stuff. A quick glance at the CL Redding Rants & Raves, reveals the same. Even if there are a lot of gun toting folks out there, I could very well imagine* someone thinking it's worth the risk. Let's face it*, CG (and KP too for that matter) is not physically imposing.

&nbsp;


It occurred to me the other day, what if KP found out at the same time the rest of us did? I don't really think that's the case, especially once she came back and claimed she was abducted, then it seems like they might start asking about the MM, etc.  If I thought they considered this case a priority I would almost wonder if they put this info out to the public to divide KP and SP a bit so they could start getting some more legit answers out of them individually.

Not saying this was a conspiracy planned and implemented by CG, but if it was, he definitely had the background, opportunity, and motive(s) to pull it off.  His trips to the Sacramento airport would be the perfect cover to manage SP's ""captivity"" in the Woodland/Yolo area.

>""I didn't eat for two weeks, I didn't sleep for two weeks, I was irritable. It was not fun,"" he said. ""You can't do this to this extreme all the time. It will kill you.""

I assume that was from the 12th when he came home from his ""doctoral level training"" gig until the Thanksgiving miracle.

If CG was running a ""Project Taken II"" scam and had SP stashed down in the Yolo/Woodland area, all his trips back and forth to the Sacramento airport could have easily included a stop the check on his ""abductee"" or her hosts.

Sunday, Nov 6:  Drives to Sacramento for trip.

Saturday, Nov 12:  Arrives home from Sacramento airport.

Tuesday, Nov 15:  Picks up AD that evening at Sacramento airport. 
 
Tuesday, Nov 15 - Wednesday, Nov 23: CG works with AD ""all week"" and they release $50k reverse ransom video on Friday, Nov 18, with offer good for ""less than 100 hours"" through Nov 22.

Wednesday Nov 23: CG and AD announce ransom now reward. 

Wednesday Nov 23: CG Drives AD back to airport? 

Thursday, Nov 24, 4am: SP ""released"".

Additional:  ""test case""?  Really?  And here is Mangas, the guy who married the Ps, doing a softball followup interview with CG where he is promoting his new brand.

Edit Additional 2:  Is this why the Gs are on the run?  Just not the dog bite lawsuit?  Are the cops looking at him for this?  Naw, if CG had played Sheriff Bo and his boys they would have him locked up long before this.

Edit Additional 3:  CG said that the AD ""may use his wealth to help the Redding-area mom and her family recover"".  And the AD did say that she was ""struggling"" in his interview.  So did the G's ever get some of that AD money?  If this was a ""Project Taken II"" scheme, and I'm not saying it was, they definitely would have wanted to make sure their actress was happy.

Unlike some other parts of the world, the United States doesn't have a kidnapping-for-ransom problem. There are only about a hundred cases a year in the entire country, and usually they involve drug dealers or bookies trying to collect on a debt. But these guys are trying to create a market for it. They are proposing a solution to a problem that doesn't exist yet, a problem that will only exist if the solution comes to be.

It just shows that LJ was really in this a lot more than she let on.

I never read that before.  $50k in 100 or 50 dollar bills isn't exactly ""thick wads of cash"".  if it were $100 x 500 it would be maybe 2.5 inches thick - easily stuck in an envelope in your pocket.

Even $50k in 20s would easily fit in a shoebox with room to spare.

Not only can't she relate the day to day events of her life as a ""abductee"", she doesn't seem to be able to recall what she was doing in the hours before she was supposedly abducted.

The only situation were I could understand her being as truthful as possible in a situation like that is if she was in a drunken or drug induced blackout.  She seems to remember having been driven 2 1/2 hours but that's it.  People in a blackout sometimes don't remember the entire day before, what they did, what they said, where they were, and who they were with.  That would be totally understandable if she was a severe alcoholic or drug user but otherwise she is evading telling them the truth.

Anyone who has dealt with an SP like personality knows that if you are not enabling them, or you're calling them out, they are going to cut you out of their life and if that is not possible than you are getting bad mouthed.

The dynamic between SP and her parents somewhat reminds me of Casey Anthony and her parents.  Accusations of abuse by a mentally unstable daughter.  Nowadays CAs parents don't speak with her and understand they can't help her.  I think SP's parents are already at that point.

Uhhh....they didn’t own the RV or the ranch. They didn’t build their house on ER’s property. They didn’t own the “farm” either...you know the little “covert location” which CG located the shipping containers and lived after the ranch. This property was also owned by ER. This was before he cut business ties (Avtac) with CG. In fact The Roles Company office location in Millville was located on the south end. Just a guess she left it at a home of a friend who took pity on them just prior to their move/run from Redding. I don’t know what you consider expensive postage, but a USPS Priority Mail is relatively inexpensive compared to what some women spend on their hair dryers. From the Gamble’s ride and her choice of shoes, sunglasses and various consumption products, they tend to try to portray an illusion of success! Nice try though farmgirl!

This whole fiasco has the smell of people “living delusional lives” while attempting to maintain an air of prosperity. The whole BS about postage being expensive so the Gambles must have money!?! My wife’s hair dryer cost $150.00...some women are funny about their hair! I would expect her to overnight that “bitch” FedEx if she forgot it somewhere.

Postage is expensive, so why not buy a new hair dryer?

I don't think they're as broke and belly up as everyone seems to thin they are.  I'll bet the hair dryer wasn't left in a box stored at her mom's house or at a friend's It was probably on their property.

I live on the same street and have not been contacted. I feel door to door search of all homes in the area!

So clearly the police weren’t doing a though job of searching around her neighborhood. Also Bosenko said they didn’t see any video footage of her leaving the area, she could have very well been hiding out near home until a night transfer to Yolo "|8||||0||1511897935.0|0|||False|0|8|Sherri’s “training” for her “marathon”|22|

One, if she's anorexic, she could use her ""training"" as the reason behind more weight loss.  Throwaway mentioned on here that she made sure after the birth of both her children she was holed up for an extended period of time, overemphasizing how traumatic it was for her fragile frame. I'm sure she was doted on, hand and foot, meals made, children cared for around the clock.  This user also had inside information that there was nothing extraordinary about either birth.  I'm thinking her demons were surfacing...marriage was boring, no job, her sister's pregnant and about to get all of the attention, in-laws aren't fawning all over her anymore, things are getting too routine.  I suspect she may have started losing weight and mentally spiraling a couple of weeks before the fateful day.

Two, it's an excuse for the kids to be in extended day care.  

And I share your thoughts about a neighbor hook up.  I've wondered that myself. "|7||||0||False|0|||False|0|7|Sherri’s “training” for her “marathon”|22|

I truly think she was in a home there with a guy. One who maybe is selling his home now or recently divorced? There was the one log about a girl finding blonde hair in a bed in a home that was empty or something that it said she believed was related to Sherri but what if the owner was actually around helping her hide out then sneaking her away in his vehicle? There were other weird things like finding girls underwear snd a running shoe and pink running jacket then one about this area that had a rock with I think rope or a knife and they went behind it and there was an empty shack that had blood and either the rope/twine/zip tie or knife I believe. I remember it really creeped me out. Then another that mentioned searching this camp across from I believe her house that had abandoned junk or a camp or rv that had a blonde doll head hanging from a tree. I got the impression someone was living there or multiple ppl and it was a drug related transient camp but I wish I could recall the exact entry. It was all before she returned because I started reading logs and would see anything posted on ws by ppl. If I didn’t hate ws and thought the thread would still exist then I would go find it. If anyone does I hope they screenshot it all and make a thread because it’s always bothered me how little it’s been looked at! I even think maybe Keith and rod found the shack thing or maybe the underwear were with that entry cause it gave me a rape vibe. 

And then there’s the checkbook that was found by Theo mailbox that the entry said may be related to this case. As bad as it sounds I preferred the case when it was a creepy one but ever since she’s been found and the hoax is clear I just find myself annoyed "|2||||0||False|0|||False|0|2|Sherri’s “training” for her “marathon”|22|

It has been said they were friends while in high school.  Tera Smith was kidnapped and most likely murdered.  They have never found her body though.  SP obviously wasn't murdered and she wasn't kidnapped, imo.  Speaking on that matter, KP had a lot of balls in contacting Tera Smith's family to ask advice, especially if this was a hoax or if he was trying to teach SP a lesson or anything hokey like that.  That most definitely conjured up many horrible memories for that poor family.  Edit:.

I promise. But please don’t compare these two. 

There was a clear motive with Tera Smith. 
This is part of the reason I care so much about the SP case. I have seen true victims get ignored for real crimes because of false reports like SP pulling a fast one. 

Tera was last seen leaving her family's residence on Tarcy Way in rural Redding, California to go for a jog between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. on August 22, 1998. She never returned home and has not been seen again.
The last person to possibly see Tera was her former martial arts instructor and boyfriend, Troy Zink. A photo of Zink is posted below this case summary. He told authorities that Tera called him during the evening hours of August 22 and asked him to meet her near her home at 6:30 p.m. Zink claimed that Tera requested $2,000 from him during the meeting. He said he refused to give her the money and she became angry. Zink said that Tera asked him to drop her off at the intersection of Old Alturas Road and Old Oregon Trail in Redding. He stated that he drove to Hang Glider Hill by himself to pray afterwards and returned to his house at approximately 11:30 p.m.

Zink was 29 years old and married with a young son at the time of his sexual relationship with Tera. He pleaded guilty to a rape charge in 1993 and spent a year in jail. He has always denied he was involved with Tera's disappearance. He said that he received a letter from Tera, which allegedly stated that she was planning to leave her home. Tera's family has maintained that she was a typical teenager who had some problems with her life, but nothing that would force her to run away. Her family said that they discovered she was planning to end her sexual relationship with Zink from several journal entries "|4||||0||False|0|||False|0|4|Is it true Sherry went to school with a girl who was also kidnapped?|21|

Now that we learned about MM and a meetup, I just can't believe that SP and KP would be planning a hoax and meanwhile SP is also planning on meeting up with someone.  The timing is just too odd.

the following is just conjecture.

honestly i thought she was dead in a ditch somewhere until i read her masterpiece skinheadz extravaganza.   then the pinterest stuff, then the buying 'spells' online crafted 'for sherri' to help attract money (i have a screenshot of that somewhere), $1 dollar shopping bags, and of course the police reports of her previous behaviour and posts here regarding a third eye blind song... 

totally pulling a stunt.  and they let her do it!  holy crap!  i'm so afraid for those kids.  if keith really loves her, she better be getting some intense therapy right now and that's why she's not speaking.  she might come out eventually.

the LE stuff is crazy.  keith really screwed up by involving the police.  they are afraid of being charged and all that gofundme money, oy!  i don't think anyone but keith knew the truth, and i don't think he knew where she was.  i think gumball might have known too.  

the one thing i cannot come up with a narrative for, is WHERE THE HELL WAS SHE???  i really really don't feel she was a 'trimmer' or had shady friends, or was tweaking for three weeks.  i mean, i don't think she purposefully took some time off to hang out and get high AF with criminals.  i don't think she was taken for punishment either because of the above.

i just don't know.  she probably rented a crap ass hotel room and stayed in her room intermittently injuring herself, and freaking out about what was transpiring back home for 3 weeks.  DD/MM was like thanks! no thanks!  don't want my wife to know i know you at all!

Redding is an outdoor enthusiast's paradise where four seasons are lucky enough to be experienced.  Redding is also home to Sherri Papini, her husband Keith, and two small children.  This attractive couple seemed to be the perfect family on the outside.  Gorgeous blonde wife with the looks of a model.  Every wall in the home covered in professional photographs of the couple.  Professional photographs of Keith lovingly looking at his wife like he knew she was out of his league.  Or the photographs of the couple in a loving embrace.  But do these seemingly perfect professional photographs tell the whole story of Sherri and Keith Papini's relationship? 

On November 2, 2016, Keith came home from a long day at work and was surprised that his stay at home wife and two children did not run to him as he walked through the door.  The eerie silence in the usually active Papini home gave Keith an uncomfortable feeling so he used a popularly app to locate Sherri’s phone since she was never without it.  But he would locate the iPhone in the grass with hair tangled around the earbuds and then he knew (insert 9-1-1 call then interview with quivering lip, sobbing Keith). 

Then a steady stream of characters started turning up in this story.  An attention seeking, self-proclaimed kidnapping expert with his pyramid scheme obsessed wife who had come across the country in a borrowed RV, with their 5 children, just so happened to be in town to help find our missing supermom.  Keith shared with the media that his wife was no longer in town and had been moved outside of Redding by kidnappers.  Then came a bible thumper anonymous donor offering a ransom in exchange for the missing supermom.  But wait?  How did anyone know our supermom was kidnapped, moved outside the area, and surely still alive?  Things were not adding up.  

But pesky DNA was found on Sherri Papini's clothing and on her person after the kidnapping.  Even peskier were the arm chair detectives who turned this case upside down... Was there more to supermom and her husband than met the eye?   Did those professional photos depicting perfection covering the walls in the Papini house, hide something sinister?

Keith never drank or did drugs in his youth, very into sports, baseball, basketball, football.  A rally fast guy, but also “showy” in how he played.  He was always funny and silly.  You could rarely ever have a serious conversation with him.  Sherri was into the DARE program and although knew a lot of people, always seemed a bit lost.  Always had a huge smile, but seemed sad in a way.

She openly told me she “used to” love cocaine, and had been spotted by the gardeners smoking crack with the boss’ personal prostitute.

According to what I have found on SP, she is listed as moving down to SoCal with her aunt and uncle, in July of 2000 until April of 2004. (her door kick-in was October of 2000) 

I had always (mistakenly, obviously) that she had graduated early somehow, but now this is just all kinds of weird. 

Why would she have her address listed in SoCal, if she still attended school in Redding? Did she get shipped off there in July, (due to some ""incident"" like TrumpIsCrazy?) come back kicking in doors in October, threatening everyone if they didn't let her back for her senior year... They relented, but only if she found someone else to put up with her for the school year, so she couch surfs her way through senior year?

She said sometimes she had sex with 2 different docs same day and did ""nasty"" things like drop in to give BJs.

She wanted cushy life driving Land Rovers in McMansion in a gated community.  No worry bout money and claims she did it for her kids.  Nevermind if new husband was fat or ugly and much older.

I think there's so much complex & weird stuff going on in and around all the key characters in this case, that if we did know all of it, we'd probably be mortified...

But even the cops are obviously trying every trick to help cover for the Papinis - as exemplified by their powerful and repeated effort to stonewall, ignore, and defy the court ordered FOIA for them to release the previously accessible public information about those prior police logs on Sherri's self-harming behavior.

WHY??? WHY did Sheriff Bosenko intentionally, willfully and illegally defy a dozen different FOIA requests from Sacrament Bee's Ryan Sabalow before finally obeying the COURT's direct order for him to release that info.

Bosenko's action even included dismantling and removing Shasta County's own long-time web service for the public to look those cases up on their own.  He Took that access OFF the PUBLIC's website just to hide access to those old police reports because he unilaterally decided that it was not fair for the public to be able to know or research that info!  He was using the Fascist-like attitude that he was on power and thus it was his right to hide public information from whoever he wanted and for whatever purpose he chose.  This action by Bosenko has done more to cause distrust of everything he says and to undermine any of the claims coming from his office that ""they believe Sherri"" or that ""there is no reason to disbelieve"" or that ""they are working diligently to find the kidnappers"".

I think Bosenko has pulled this same kind of egomaniac BS on the public in many other areas beyond just stonewalling the police reports

- they knew where sherri was 2 days before she reappeared 
-  she has drug problems 
-  she hooks up with other men
-  Sherri and/or Keith have friends whose parents hold high positions in Shasta County LE or places to exert pressure for a coverup

I was told the coverup is because it’s embarrassing to Keith that he was such an idiot about her affairs and drug use and leaving not only him but the kids.

My insider was right about Michigan so maybe we’ll find out if the above is true.

I still can’t wrap my head around why the police would cover up this nonsense unless they bungled the case.

She also posted a lot of ""we're doing everything we can"" type stuff. She and a couple others in particular seemed very active in trying to bring SP home.  Of course none of them have said a thing since she was found but that's another rant which I've already beaten into the ground.

Anyway, this person whose initials are AB went to a Christmas party in December 2016, not too long after SP was found, and she tagged a friend that was also at the party, the friend who was tagged is this guy: https://imgur.com/a/MFr0F - so we'd all be fools to assume there weren't favors being called into SCSO and that they didn't give this case all kinds of special treatment and they're hiding a lot from the public for sure.

A lot of Sherri's close friends have friends that work for the sheriff's office in some capacity, and I'm not joking when I say its eerie how almost all of these people have similar semi-professional photos taken of themselves and their families, it's almost like a requirement or a competition who can look more attractive and happy.  Also most of them seem pretty religious, whether they are members of Bethel or not, a lot of them have these connections within churches, schools, business groups, etc.  




So yeah, I'm pretty sure SCSO knows a lot more than they're letting on and they've been doing favors and keeping secrets. And lets not forget there is money involved, and although it's not much money it involves a lot of individual donations, and there was a lot of time spent by the community.  And frankly the entire town already looks completely insane when you factor in Gamble and the AD, I'm sure everyone just wants it to go away by now, especially SCSO."|12||||0||1511764976.0|0|||False|0|12|Can anymore tell us if SP had affairs or a drug problem?

Can you elaborate on that thought? It seems like a pretty big jump to go from ""she's a fake, stepford-ish chick"" to ""she faked her own kidnapping/ran off"" at least at first.  People (women) DO get kidnapped, so even if I didn't like her, I might initially think that's what really happened. 

Did you ever (even initially) think KP was guilty of harming her? Sadly, that is what usually happens in these cases. 

What do you think about the rumors of SP having an eating disorder?

But the show is about 4 millennials who are searching for a friend that has gone missing in NYC. The main girl's life is very unfulfilled by work and she throws herself into the case entirely. It is a bit of a comedy of errors in which their curiosity and desire make this a meaningful experience distorts their ability to put clues together in a level headed manner. The group constantly gets ahead of themselves and eventually the pay-off is the exact opposite of their desire. Check it out on TBS.

I don't think the P's have good friends. I think KP or was it SK saying they don't even social media was leakage. They aren't discrete or private they are reclusive and secretive and have been for some time. I don't think there is much of a story to tell/sell because they don't have close friends. 

I think the cash left in the house on the day of the disappearance is foreshadowing and leakage as well. You might be surprised how far you can go untracked on cash. She might not be rich but 22 days is less than a pay check for most people that's a matter of a couple of late payment fees in their life even on Best Buy and weed trimming wages. If she was gone longer the might necessitate an actual ""hoax"" or orchestrated event but 22 days doesn't take much means or intelligence. 1000 dollars minus a weeks daycare plus enough money to starve for 22 days, big whoop

Dynamic in P household- pressure cooker. Anything is possible and running off is better than murder suicide 

CG and JG- like others said opportunists. Just wanted a moment to shine. Weren't  knowledgeable of full situation. Could have been manipulated easily due to eagerness to be ""something"" great 

I tend to think SP was acting up. She might have had a good reason besides being unstable and disordered. KP and cast could have aggravated it. 

When KP speaks of the aftermath of her ordeal he says ""I don't know how to deal with it"" IMO he is trying to reconcile guilt ""I can't handle her, it's my fault, I don't know what to do with her/with this""

Her family knows she has pussy whooped muhfas out there that will keep her secrets they think she abused etc they thought KP was the 666. They thought they were helping. Hence family saying ""someone she knows"" they now she sinks that game in the minds of those she needs

If anyone wants me continue or elaborate just lemme know

KP can't afford girls weekends on BB money and I don't think she planned to leave for good, maybe before MM dumped her ass but when she left. 

When MM cancelled the extra money turned into money for 22 days of starvation. You can easily give some crack head some money to get motel room for (you don't have to go in to lobby) and enough money for some crack and make some moves in the dark for 3 weeks.

I think there is a rabbit warren of driveways branching off of the street that starts at the mailbox.  That's were he figured she had been taken from.

My theory right along is that she walked down to the mailboxes so that the person/people picking her up didn't have to figure out how to get to the house and take the time to get there.  Even with GPS it can be tricky with some many different driveways.  Also perhaps she didn't want them to come to the house for various reasons.  Alternately they could have come to the house and he planted the phone at the end of the driveway to get the cops serious about finding her.

In the first pictures taken after her return, I noticed that he had a wireless camera on the rail of the front porch.  I'm guessing that, because he installs these things all the time, it was installed prior to her going missing.  I someone came to the house it should have picked it up.  It should have also picked up her comings and goings and what she was wearing.

In this case it was an elderly friend being kidnapped and extorted by people he knew. Obviously they wanted his money for some reason, I am presuming to pay for a drug habit judging by their mugshots.

What's most interesting about it is that some of the people involved also appear to know Tiffany Nicole Berlan (Shasta's Wanted for managing a drug house) and possibly Donnie Stroud (who was the one linked to Sherri as an ex-con/ex boyfriend). As far as facebook evidence goes, Donnie Stroud seems to be doing well in the tattoo business as a legit artist - who was fairly active work-wise during the time of the disappearance. I am doubting his involvement.

TBH I don't think there are any direct links, but it does establish that there's a circle of people in Redding who know/are friends with each other and are also involved in meth/drug dealing/petty theft etc."|7||||0||False|0|||False|0|7|Shastas wanted|22|

I also don't think a wife texting her husband to ask if he's coming home for lunch is weird. It's the context of the situation that makes the text stand out to me. I feel like people are overlooking that detail because it does seem normal. If he came home for lunch several times a week, I could see why she'd check to see if he's coming home. Maybe she planned to run errands and didn't want to miss him. However, if he only came home for lunch once a month, then it would seem oddly coincidental that on the same day she disappeared she checked to see what her husbands plans were that day. 

I think she was either fishing to see if he was coming home so she could go do something behind his back and he, being suspicious already, was tipped off that she may have been up to something. "|13||||0||False|0|||False|0|13|Two Details I'm Hung Up On|50|

Another anomaly that probably has something to do with her disappearance.

My latest is that SP planned to meet MM in Woodland that afternoon and had already arranged transportation to pick her up.  He had flown into Sacramento earlier that week and driven to his SF medical conference. He was driving back that afternoon and planned his rendezvous with SP for that evening and would catch a morning flight back to DTW and be picked up by his loving missus none the wiser.

Problem is MM's wife was tipped off that afternoon of his plans and she called him and told him if he was not on the next flight that afternoon there would be a divorce.  MM changes plans and catches the next flight home.  Who tipped her?  Best candidate is that KP knew about M&M and had already discovered his wife gone earlier that afternoon.

Meanwhile SP is already in transit with her Los Ubers driver(s) sans phone which she left in her car so KP couldn't track it.  She arrives in Woodland and MM is not at their rendezvous location and she is not sure why.  By that evening she has to make other plans with her old aquantances in the area.

This is why LE sent 2 cops to Detroit.  They thought she might have travelled with him.  Or maybe they thought he met and killed her in Woodland.

Additional:  If the Ps read this stuff they must get a real laugh out of some of these theories.  Getting close?"|12||||0||1511624215.0|0|||False|0|12|Two Details I'm Hung Up On|50|

Since he was already in there, he hopped in and tracked her phone.  I think he was suspicious of her big time, either her cheating or doing drugs or both.

I'm not sold on the fact that he knew about MM, specifically though.  Keith to me seems pussy-whooped and clueless.  There's no way he would have the balls to call MM's wife.  He would be sniveling all over that 911 call and/or police interview singing like a canary about how his wife was so beautiful, so wonderful, so extraordinary that she has been harassed by a suitor in Michigan, and he must have stolen her off the street!

I still believe the phone was left by the mailboxes by Sherri, with every intention of coming back to get it after getting high/getting it on. There was a neighbor that spotted her on the phone out around this area, but I'm going to have to dig that news report up for the source.

I still think she texted him about lunch because she wanted to make sure he was NOT coming home.  I'm sure he got that text and did not know how to respond (he clearly was paranoid that she was doing something on the side without him).  I think he kept her guessing by keeping silent, hoping that she would remain dutiful and be there for snuggle time.

I'm beginning to see the half-wrapped gift as a subtle f u to Keith, and also a ""don't be pissed at me because I was late picking up the kids and we had a late fee for the umteenth time this year...I got so busy wrapping a handmade gift for YOU."" I think everything this woman does and says is image-building, so nothing will ever be entirely her fault.  "|10||||0||False|0|||False|0|10|Two Details I'm Hung Up On|50|

Could he have taken it home and parked it behind his car, not expecting to go out again? Then when he went on his search, he couldn't use his Geekmobile for non-company business like tracking down his wife. 
  I'm curious about the cell phones-who shut them down. I would love to know if KP saw Sherri's text and just ignored it until late afternoon. Did she get pissed? Were the phones off at lunch time and the text wasn't received till later? Why did KP mention the crappy service on the 911 call? Did we hear the whole call or is there more info before he was transferred to the operator on the released tape? I think we all can surmise that this was not some random Dos Latinas kidnaping spree. I wish there were a few more breadcrumbs to follow.

If it were true the phones were off and he had to run to the AT&T store, one would assume he starts calling to check on wife, maybe even call the daycare.

So many possibilities here, personally, I'll give the benefit of the doubt on him grabbing her car which had we presume had the carseats.   And maybe his mom picked up the kids enough that she had purchased her own carseats, since most new ones come with bases that we get used to leaving in the car for convenience.

Her running off due to a past drug problem is high on my list of possible theories, and if true, I wouldn't be surprised to find out she had a history of it, forcing KP to escalate things since the police wouldn't make her a priority in that reoccurring scenario."|10||||0||False|0|||False|0|10|Two Details I'm Hung Up On|50|

&nbsp;

1. 11/1 - MM is in town to see a conference and to make hump on SP, but he gets called back home early for some reason.  He tells SP to go ahead and stick to the plan and sit tight in the AirBNB he’s rented for the month out in Woodland, he calls it Project BangHouse.  He left a keybox at Project BangHouse and assures her he’ll brb once he deals with whatever there is in Michigan that needs tending to.

2. 11/2 - SP disappears, leaves her phone on purpose to make it appear she’d been abducted. Being that she had jobs in the mobile phone business, she knew it would be found. She and KP had likely discussed or used ‘find my iphone’ before.

3. KP Calls the cops. The cops aren’t convinced it’s an abduction, no tire tracks or footprints, dogs don’t smell anything.

4. The network of super friends gathers and begins calling in their contacts, pressuring LE to consider this case an abduction.

5. LE Starts unleashing warrants for phone history and whatnot.

6. 11/6 - Anonymous Donor sees pretty blonde girl on TV, chubs up a bit but can’t admit to himself that he only wants to help her because he’s attracted to her and wants her to love him. He’s a creepy old man. Gives zero shits about any other missing person either prior or since. He contacts the police with his big idea, he’s going to be a hero, he just knows it. Boss hog tells him to go kick rocks and that he doesn’t go down to the mega church and tell him how to do *his* job.

7. 11/7 - AD, determined to get a hug from Sherri registers sherripapini.com and makes a facebook account. He hums the song “Oh Sherrie” by Journey to himself, he has a skip in his step and hasn’t felt this great in years.

8. AD gets in touch with Lisa Jeter somehow. She giggles because she’s talking to someone worth at least $50k for the first time ever, she’s star struck. 

9. 11/8 - LJ Calls Keith and presents the idea of having a weird old man pay for his wife to come home, but Keith says it sounds like a bad movie and he’s not exactly ready to look like a dunce just yet. Nobody tells him he’s already looking like both a dunce and a murder suspect by now.

10. Meanwhile, back at Headquarters, the cops get text info back from AT&T and find out SP’s text-humping with a guy from Michigan.

11. 11/9 - A couple of Shasta’s finest fly out to Detroit, they sing “Detroit Rock City” in their rented Ford Taurus off and on for 2 days straight while they chase down the Michigan Man.

12. 11/10 - Back at home, KP is taking a lie detector test.  Later that day the cops let him know that his wife was texting a dude in michigan and that the other cops are out there right now giving this man a good talking-to. 

13. KP is shocked that SP would ever talk to another man, he wonders what is the meaning of life? He might be a little stoned.

14. 11/11  The Shasta cops in Michigan finally sit down with the MM, who assures them he came home without ever meeting up with SP, they believe him, he pays for a pretty decent lunch so they do him a solid and don’t tell his wife. They fly back home.

15. MM grabs his burner and calls SP on her burner, he tells her the fuzz came by and uses some code like “black dog runs at night” which means “I’m not coming back to Project BangHouse - good luck out there. -MM OUT!”

16. 11/12 - KP is still wandering around like a zombie, in disbelief that his blonde would speak to another man. He’s pretty dang disappointed, even a little sore at her dang it!

17. 11/13 - SP calls KP from her burner and lets him know she made a huge mistake, she’s been watching the news on the 55” flat screen at Project BangHouse and now realizes KP loves her and she loves him, and that GFM money is sounding pretty freakin dope by now.  She just wants to come home but then Mama Papini and RR3 might not be so generous once they find out the truth about our girl, and of course that sexy ass $50k in GFM bucks is as good as gone if she just admits she was out trying to get some dong.

18. KP tells SP about the old creeper with the $50k and how he wanted to offer it as a “ransom.” SP is ecstatic, she pulls out this story about some latinas she had in the archives and tells KP to go ahead and call this guy, once he offers the money she’ll run down to the church and get rescued - meanwhile she’ll start kicking her own ass a bit. 

19. 11/14 - KP texts LJ and says “its go time! Let that weird old man know I *will* take that $50k offer.

20. 11/15 - LJ calls the weird old man back. Trying to be helpful, LJ suggests he contact Cameron Gamble, the financially strapped love child of Tom Cruise and Liam Neeson.  This is CG’s first call for his services. Ever. He had prayed and The Father told him to do some talks at the local Elk’s Club and here it was paying dividends.

21. 11/16 - CG and AD talk, AD is ecstatic - he’s going to get that hug from SP, it’s really going to happen!  AD books a flight to Sacramento for later that evening. CG meets up with Keith.  Keith breaks down and starts crying, and spills the beans to Gamble, he tells him all about the MM, Project BangHouse, everything… Gamble makes him pray, KP wonders why he’s talking about himself so much in the prayer and why it’s lasting like 45 minutes.  Gamble says he can still help, he’ll just go ahead and lure her out of Project BangHouse with some very serious videos.

22. Later that night, CG picks up AD from Sacramento Airport because he literally had nothing else going on.  They stay up all night to make the weird ransom letter more self-serving. They change like 4 lines but it takes until dawn for some reason.

23. 11/17 - Tired from the long night, CG and AD launch the website and put a bunch of other confusing shit into motion that to this day, nobody is actually all that clear about.

24. 11/18 - KP is making progress with her daily bruises while all alone at Project BangHouse, she’s pretty excited to get home and get her hands on that GFM dough, which KP and SP herein refer to as “The Nifty Fifty.”

25. Cameron Gamble releases some videos, which SP sees.  She wonders why this little guy is suddenly involved, she doesn’t like the cut of his jib and figures she had better ramp up this whole abduction scenario. She goes out the the garage and gathers some junk to make some restraints with.

26. 11/19 - SP calls KP again and tells him she’s going to need a few more days to really get into character for her re-appearance, they agree on early morning Thanksgiving, that way he doesn’t have to eat those disgusting sweet potatoes anyway. KP lets CG know the plan for her to return on Thanksgiving.

27. 11/20 - SP uses the stove and some metal junk she found laying around at Project Banghouse to brand herself, KP’s going to be so excited when he sees how committed she is to this whole thing. 

28. 11/22 - CG watches “Ransom.”  Twice.

29. 11/23  - CG puts out the “Reverse Ransom” video.  The public is now confused as shit. Is it 50k? 100k? And what the hell is a  “Reverse Ransom?” These questions will never be answered.

30. SP Sees CG’s video, it comes at the perfect time since she’s planning on returning early am the next day. And now her friend LJ can feel useful.

31. 11/24 - SP Wakes up, puts on her junk from the garage, leaves Project BangHouse and scurries down the road a couple blocks to the Jahova’s Witness church…

32. KPs phone rings.  He lets it go to voicemail, thinking to himself “you cheat on the Kiethster and think you’re getting first answer? I don’t think so…”  Phone rings again and this time he answers. It’s our girl.

1. SP is having an affair with Michigan Man. He cancels his visit to CA. SP reacts crazily, and wants to pull something big to get attention from him. Then - the a-ha moment! Michigan Man will feel so bad for poor Sherri once she goes missing. When she comes back, he'll admire her courageous displays of bravery and strength as a survivor. (*I could also see SP just meeting some guy, unrelated to MM, and planning to run away with him.*)

2. SP finds another guy and makes arrangements to stay with him. She ties up loose ends in Redding, stages a kidnapping, and prepares to come back on Thanksgiving. I could see her dropping a few hints to KP during her prep time. 

3. SP leaves with her new man. Upon realizing that SP's MIA, KP assumes she's cheating, which is why he uses the Find My Phone app.  After finding her phone and coded message hair near the mailboxes, he calls the police. KP progressively becomes more concerned as time passes - but still holds strong suspicion that she disappeared voluntarily.

4. LJ, a friend of KP and SP's, brings in CG. KP maybe tells CG he suspects SP voluntarily disappeared. CG sees it as a safe case and an easy opportunity to make a name for himself.

5. CG sensationalizes the case and tries to get it (himself) into the media. CG assumes that SP's fate is similar to most abductees (murder), so thinking that she won't be back, he takes liberty to make his role in the case as dramatic and media-grabbing as possible. Or, the opposite; he suspected she wouls be coming back (maybe even on Thanksgiving), so he times the media kerfuffles around mid-late November to make it look like his ""reverse ransom"" was responsible. 

6. The AD is hoaxish somehow. I'm just not sure what the story is behind it. Maybe CG just recruited someone from Bethel to say they'll contribute the money, but nothing was ever actually committed to? The AD could be CG, but then who was on Chris Hansen's show? Whatever happened, I don't believe that any money was actually exchanged.

7. Apparently KP told his kids that SP would be back for Thanksgiving; he had to have had a reason to think this. This could be like a cryptic hint she dropped beforehand. So he's up early on Thanksgiving, waiting for a phone call to see if he's right. 

8. SP, while missing, is doing BDSM stuff with her guy. Brands herself or gets mystery man to do it.  

9. SP comes back on Thanksgiving. Everyone starts to doubt the story, and the Papinis and Gambles freak out.

The biggest flaw in my theory is that this mystery man remains unaccounted for. Were the two of them somehow completely avoiding the news during her disappearance? Or was he aware of what was going on, and knowingly helped her disappear?  There would have had to be some communication beforehand between the two of them. Where is that? 

It also means the guy would have had to fly under LE's radar, and not come forward himself. Or maybe LE does know about him, but just hasn't said anything.

Here is cleaner version of IMHO rough narrative:

1.  SP leaves a note saying going to take off for few days. Withdrew some cash for drug binge.

2.  KP is pissed and decided to teach SP a lesson and humble her. Sp even left her phone knowing KP will try to track her.

3.  KP calls 911 suspecting some kind of foul play and contacts SP's friend LJ who says I just saw SP at eye lash trimming joint in the mall.

4.  LJ believes KP and recalls CG giving some talk bout hostage taking and sex trafficking fantasy. LJ reaches out and hooks KP with CG.

5.  SP is pissed to hilt at KP with media going gaga all over.

6.  SP contacts KP telling him she is safe. Just on a drug fueled sex bend.

7.  In the mean time CG tells KP that he can make some easy GFM and Cali victim assistance money. Just trust CG to take over the narrative.

8.  KP being not too bright allows CG to take over. CG sees the SP saga as 1 way ticket to fame and $$$. CG being a LIAR and slick con-man contacts the Bethelite AD. CG whips up the AD spin to legitimize his claim as hostage negotiator, NOT!

9.  CG, KP and SP plan the miracle return. CG doubles down the pot knowing not a cent will be spent. CG is on a roll in limelight. CG also demands some cut from GFM and VA for his ""service"". KG agrees.

10.  CG orchestrates the SP's return including the sex trafficking spins with bad banditas and clumsy chains and so on. CG roughs up SP to boot. KP seeing SP beat up is pissed.

11.  SP miracle on Thanksgiving but the story unravels. Major fall out between the Paps and CG ensues. But both Paps and Gams are deeply intertwined with conflicting accounts given to LE.

12.  CG whips it all up and Paps realize they have been con'ed. Paps reneges on CG's ""commission"".

13.  Paps and Gams are at odds at the same time afraid as 1 side can snitch on thew other. It's their best interest for the SP saga to quietly go away. Paps can lose the GFM but definitely forced to pay back Cali VA fund and both thrown in jail for giving false testimonies. CG might join KP in same jail for obstruction of justice and well documented false testimonies to LE not to mention the limelight he was in.

14.  Paps monitor Reddit but Gams are very active with slew of alias to make the Paps look bad while they are innocent as they can be as noted by JG's ode to her hero CG the con. Both parties are scared sxitless as Sheriff Bo and Det Jackson might be hot on their tails.

Without getting into a long, well-formatted post like you two, I think:  

SP purposely took off, taunting KP by leaving her cell where he'd find it.  I believe she has a burner phone.

KP thought he'd call her bluff by reporting her missing-not a hoax!  I do NOT believe the two chatted while she was missing, as LE could trace cell phone data.

The stupidity of the masses falling for the con & donating to the Go Find Money account were just gravy for these yahoos.  Getting the Gam Squad et al involved was probably more balls than Keefy wanted to juggle, but shit happens.  

She was with some man, and came up with her ""story"" about the despicable Latina Ladies because she's a racist bigot.  Her family showed little concern because they've seen this skit play out over and over and over for half of Sherri's lifetime.

""The wheels of justice grind exceedingly slow, but they grind exceedingly fine.""  I firmly believe in this.     "|11||||0||False|0|||False|0|11|OK - Maybe we can all chip in and share what happened with the key players SP, KP and CG?|20|

Uh, yeah that's great, but you don't own it so the fanciness does not reflect on you at all CamGam!

Something is definitely not on the up and up with them (duh, right? Haha). JenGam brags about Cam buying her an Escalade...but they had already owned one and says they only had an old farm truck ( https://imgur.com/a/BrUM0). They also had what looks like a nice boat (which they supposedly sold to build their house) so either they had money, or they didn't. IMO, they were downplaying their income* in order to get donations, but they also had no problem bragging  about their  stuff. 

So.Damn. Strange. And probably somehow part of a massive gift. 

*edit: CamGam was probably making decent money working construction while still getting donations for his ProjectTaken thing. Too bad that wasn't good enough for them

If I recall correctly, I had read/heard somewhere that the family was not happy with LE from the start because they had not confirmed the fact that her disappearance was involuntary.  The family also had the mayor on their side, who appeared to be taking a special interest in this case and in this family.  I would not be surprised if there was pressure on the sheriff from many channels and that is why they publicly changed the classification to an abduction and have reluctantly maintained to the public that they have been investigating her disappearance as an abduction.  But who knows what they have knowledge to behind closed doors, they could have been gathering proof this whole time that she voluntarily left that day, or that she was legitimately abducted but there is more to the story than what they have been told by SP and everyone else involved.  If that is true, then before they publicly come forward with any conclusions to their investigations they will likely make sure they have solid proof of their findings or else they will feel the sting of the P's and whatever political forces were coming down on them in the beginning.|4||||0||False|0|||False|0|4|Bosenko Provides Evidence That Someone Else Planted The Phone|27|

It would be interesting to know where they had the dogs start and where exactly the dogs stopped tracking her scent.  Would they have started the dogs at the front door of the house- you would think her scent was able to be picked up there.  So where did the dogs lose that scent?  The end of the driveway, on the way to the mailboxes, anywhere?

Pages 1-5 have a chart that delineates the labels the Sheriff has given this case——- and the labels it has NOT given this case like “stranger abduction”.

😭Sometimes you just have to LET IT OUT. l will never again let the critic silence me. I’ve been keeping this inside for too long.🔥
.
“A true hero isn’t measured by the size of his strength, it is measure by the size of his heart.” Hercules.
.
There are moments in life that define you. Moments that test the truest of hearts and the integrity of who you claim to be. These moments are never easy and they seldom come without backlash. But that happens because these moments are the what separates a hero from the rest.
.
This man is a hero. He has committed his life to helping others. Without recognition, without the spotlight, and sometimes without a thank you. But he continues without hesitation, without wavering and without letting the opinions of others distract him from his mission.
.
A year ago he was asked to help in a helpless situation. l remember him coming home to me and asking what l thought he should do. Without hesitation l told him that if l was ever in a situation like this, l would pray that someone like him would help me.
.
It wasn’t conventional. It wasn’t easy. It required a lot of risk and sacrificed a lot of what we had built for our lives...but, it was a matter of saving a life.
.
And that is what he did. Regardless of how it was spun. Regardless of the backlash. Regardless of the lies and propaganda that was spread. We stand confidently in the truth and will be thankful for the day that truth is revealed. At the end of the day this man did G O O D. At the end of the day, we wouldn’t change a change thing. .
Sometimes in life you will be faced with a situation that will require every part of you, every ounce of courage and every bit of your heart. These are the defining moments in your life, don’t run from them.

Friends, you can’t be all the good the world needs. But the world needs all the good you can be."|8||||0||False|0|||False|0|8|The November 14-18 time frame|14|

He has a picture of it with an evidence marker #3. KP didn't mention it in his 911 call and when asked what she was wearing said he assumed it was athletic clothes.

>911: Do you know what she was wearing? Is there something she always wears … 

>Papini: No. I’m assuming she went running, so athletic-type clothing.

Hansen's statement is just after 2:20 in this youtube version:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpUMv_KoXow

If KP did indeed find her running jacket, this opens up a lot of questions. #1 for me would be why would she take it off and why would her ""abductors"" ask her to or give her the time to? #2 would be why KP didn't mention it to 911.

I guess this really just didn't happen and Hansen has it wrong. But why does he have a picture of it with and evidence tag?  Was it found later by someone else?  Were the phone, earbuds, and this jacket all planted?

Additional:  I assume the phone and possibly the earbuds because they were together was evidence marker #1.  If the jacket was #3, what was #2?  The fact that the jacket was a low number does give credence to the fact that it was one of the first things marked and they found it when first out on the scene.  How did it suddenly appear if it wasn't there on the 911 call?  Planted as an afterthought to add to the phone and further bolster the case that she was taken?"|9||||0||1511454047.0|0|||False|0|9|The Pink Running Jacket|12|https://i.redditmedia.com/Ty_UNenkpquwTjAnSaAB5GZPLx6ZcvKPQ8unjC1xyOI.jpg?s=2df07dd4257979e3c8d01ffeab277ede

There is something called the CSI effect, where LE TV shows have created a vast public misperception about forensic science.  My sister is a forensic specialist for LE (badge and gun included).  I’ve spoken to her extensively about this case.  Her specialty is in chemistry area.  My county in CA currently has a 12-18 month backlog for DNA and fingerprints.  Rapes and murders get priority.  Please know the system is still searching for a possible match, and may actually find a match in future.  Gender is the easiest markers for DNA to determine.  Race is a tough marker to use because categories do not have measurable and observable characteristics like gender.  For example if the DNA showed Caucasian, hair color can be blonde, brown, or black.  I posted about this previously. Unless the DNA was of hair sample variety, hair color may not be known at this time.  I wish Jackson had shared what the DNA sample was, because without that info, so much is unknown (thanks Jackson btw because I know you read these forums and didn’t release what you have intentionally).  

I saw someone thought maybe if a judge signed a search warrant for getting CG’s DNA swabbed, Jackson would be on a plane.  It would be far cheaper and easier to have NC jurisdictional LE get the sample for SCSO and overnight it back to them.  I’m willing to bet my right thumb (hey it’s my dominant arm so favored digit) that a search warrant went out for quite a few people... when it went out for KPs!  I hate typing this because the Gambles equally  skim our comments, but they are absolutely watching his technology activity.  Releasing the DNA info was intentional to get someone to panic.

An investigator can not collect a DNA sample from someone they consider a suspect in a crime, but have not yet arrested. Unless the DNA is legally obtained through consent or a search warrant, the law does not authorize collection of DNA samples from suspects in criminal investigations.

SP’s chain location and one zip tie to the chain spoke volumes about this being a criminal.   I thought I read elsewhere (could be wrong) that she was right handed?  Did she maybe notate her right hand being injured in the fight with Latinas during high school? Well assuming that was her. 

Speaking of that... I’ve been questioning another theory.  What if SP did something really heinous to these undocumented women and they merely paid retribution? I mean the white supremacy blog post may have been her but the biggest indicator was KP’s word usage in a press release using “subhuman” and “race war”... you know he had people in his inner circle check that statement first and they all gave him a thumb up on releasing it.  They didn’t notice the vocabulary usage as outside the ordinary when it actually is.  Middle class America only uses those two terms if they are writing a college paper on Nazis propaganda for history class OR they themselves are part of some group that uses that semantical structure.  Then KP uses terms of idolization of SP’s blonde hair.  Interesting.  Hitler spoke the same way about ethnic cleansing and “purity” as evidenced by hair color.  

I’ve started researching white supremacy hate groups in the area.  Let’s assume SP did something to piss off two Spanish speaking women.  There is probably a technological footprint somewhere using a pseudo name.  We need to search boards and blogs of white groups right before her disappearance.  Wonder if she bragged about what she did?  Could explain why Sheriff and his posse aren’t worried about this happening again?  It was retaliation.  The brand? Ruining her perfect body through an oppressive practice. Maybe the brand really has zero meaning other than to make her feel ugly and imperfect.  After all, Hitler didn’t like deformities or impurities.

If it was an in-home daycare and was paid in cash, the reasoning for that would likely be that the caregiver did not report that income on her taxes.  If the P's paid in cash and it wasn't reported by the caregiver I would think they did not report it as a deduction on their taxes either.  Which would be foolish on their part cause that could be a nice write off for them.  If they used an actual daycare facility I don't really see them paying cash for that unless they got a receipt or some kind of invoice when they paid each time because they would use those documents as accountable records for their taxes when they filed each year.

I'm sure, at first, our large cash withdrawls looked odd, and we definitely got some looks always paying both in cash.  I always felt like they thought some thing was up, like we were selling drugs or something.  

Anyway, paying in cash may have been for that reason.  Or maybe, like someone I know, her parents give her wads of cash to pay for daycare, groceries, whatever.  So it could have been something like that as well.  

I do wonder if she was setting extra cash aside for whatever reason, but I doubt we'll ever know.  "|4||||0||False|0|||False|0|4|That Daycare Cash and Other Random Thoughts.|35|

I've been lurking here for a while. I'm finally posting. I remember another person in the child development field posted similar information on a different thread but I can't find it. 

I work in the ECE field and I am very familiar with the different types of pre school programs. There are basically 4 types.  1) Tuition based programs. Meaning parents pay a set amount of dollars per week per child. Ages 6 weeks - 2 years old is over $300 per week full time. 2-3 years old is a little cheaper especially if they are potty trained. My program for 3-5 year olds is $220 a week. We offer 1/2 day 8:00-12:00 or 2 day and 3 day options. Sometimes these programs offer tuition assistance depending on the need but only about 10%. In my program tuition is due first day of the month. Most pay in full. Some do bi-monthly. It's usually paid by CC card or check. Very few pay cash. Day care is expensive for a single income family.

2) State funded preschool which is based on family size and income. As of now families only need to qualify once a year. My program also serves these type of families. Some have 100% paid tuition some have a sliding scale. In order for a family like the Panpinis to qualify, and with the ages of the children Sherri would have to be a student or seeking employment. They would not just enroll the kids if Sherri just felt like enrolling them. There has to be a need. With this program based on KPs salary they would qualify for 6 hours a day because SP is not working.  They could have more hours if she were in school and had study hours. However, say KP made 60,000 a year they would be responsible for partial tuition. The hours are set. If I know one of my students whose contract says they have to leave by 4:30 and it's already 5:00 we call the parents.
There are also a few state funded preschools that operate 1/2 day. 8-11:30 or 12:30-4:00. These types are based upon family income. I highly doubt the younger one would qualify.

3) Head Start/ Early Head Start. This is for families below poverty level. Because of their ages the younger one would of been in Early Head Start  (infant-age 3) The older one in regular head start. These are 1/2 day or 3.5 hours. I highly doubt they qualify. This program also requires a lot more paperwork.

4) parent co-op. A free program but the parents are responsible for putting in so many hours for the program to run. The school depends on parents to help to maintain the child-adult ratios. There are also community based programs that are super cheap. However those drop off and pick up times don't make sense since these programs are usually a few hours. 

Shasta ECE where some think they went gives priority to faculty and students attending the college. 

A few other determining factors can play a part. Do the kids have an IEP, are they on Cal works. These factors can help them qualify for free or reduced tuition. 

The kids could of been going to a in home daycare. However, most of my friends who go to a in home day care refer to it as the babysitter. If they were going to a in home day care I'm sure for part time it would be at least $200 a week. KP specifically called it Daycare. Which tells me they went to a actual center.

Now people question why send your kids to daycare/preschool if your not working? Well based upon my experience only about 10% of families I work with take this route. Most families send their kids because they are both working. Those 10% who don't work have a higher income and can afford daycare. Now go into a more affluent area then that 10% is closer to 80%. Parents send their kids to get social interactions, cognitive development and physical development. They can afford tuition. I am a strong advocate for early education. 

Based upon what we know. The Panpinis probably did not have a lot of expenses. Especially if the house they were in was not in their name. The cost of living up in Redding is cheaper than let's say Orange County. Perhaps SP needed a break during the day to do her thing. I.E. selling stuff on itsy and other online sites, which is understandable. 

Having cash to pay day care most likely didn't hurt them. Plus it's a write off on their taxes. My only concern is why were they there till 4:30 usually.

It seems to operate from September through May, 9:00 am until 2:00 pm. There is no mention of extended hours (until 4:45 as Keith claimed) or summer semester. 

The place seems to be an actual preschool, as opposed to a daycare that accommodates working parents. It is a Head Start program, so maybe there is a program that does go past 2:00. I don’t have the balls to call and ask. 

And now, an editorial: If SP had been laid off in September, there was absolutely no need for the kids to be there past 2:00. And the cost would have made it even less practical. 

I am a SAHM and did put my kids in preschool. Yes, for socialization and to allow me to get chores done, etc. but they were short little days and there was no way to justify having them there all afternoon. 

Maybe she conned someone into thinking that she was going back to work or was starting a business from home and needed them gone from 9:00-5:00.

I'll say that though my wife is a stay at home mom, our 3rd kid did go to a nearly all day pre-school a few days a week but it followed more closely with regular school hours, something like 9-3 or something in there.  And that was when our kid was 4-5 years old, not prior.  And it wasn't daycare at all, in fact I believe they actually went through Kindergarten and beyond there.  So I guess what I'm saying is it never really bothered me too much that SP had the kids in daycare.  But your info here really spells out all the differences between these types of things.  



I think in the beginning, I though more about the daycare situation though, and have since kind of let it go.  Thinking about it more, I do wonder if she had them there because she was overwhelmed with everything that goes along with being a mom, and if KP and even some of the other family members may have known she was over her head a bit.  Not trying to be judgmental about how they live their lives so much as wondering if its an indicator of some mental health issues.  I could be going way out on a limb there but I've always had the impression SP was emotionally needy."|2||||0||False|0|||False|0|2|That Daycare Cash and Other Random Thoughts.|35|

I immediately called the private investigator on this. He said it was $1,200 she withdrew from the bank. She paid off their daycare, and the remaining amount was in her wallet still in their bedroom.""



So assuming it's true, she actually probably had just a couple hundred left.

Tuition will be calculated based on the number of contracted days or hours of enrollment in a semester.

> 2. Children are enrolled a minimum of two days per week from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.

No, you're reading it wrong: two days a week from 9am-2pm is the minimum enrollment, and therefore the minimum payment, as per the above quote from the parent handbook tuition policy.  

The parent handbook also says that tuition can be paid with cash, check or credit card. So I really don't think there's any mystery regarding the daycare.

I don't think daycare had extra long open hours just for SP. That would lead to a host of legal and insurance problems, if something happened to the kid in the ""extra hours"". 

If the normal pick up time was 2PM, then I'm sure KP would have mentioned it in the 911 call, since that would back up his story that SP had been taken, and not just lost track of time. And why would KP lie about normal pick up time to the 911 operator? That's such an easy thing to prove/disprove.

I think it's more likely that the daycare has a weekly day with long hours, and that SP chose that day to go awol, because she knew the kids would be safe until KP came home from work, and no one would raise the alarm until then.

If someone was writing this as a novel, and I was editing their book, I would have told them that the part about the phones being off on that particular day was too over-the-top, not believable, especially on top of everything else.

Also, the coincidence of her planning to meet Michigan man.  I mean, according to LE they were talking/texting/whatever they were doing for a while.  And it just so happens that she disappears at approximately the same time they were going to meet up?  Again, I'd tell the author of the novel it's too much coincidence unless it played in to their storyline in a climactic way.

And the biggest thing that makes this unlikely and seem totally scripted and unreal is that she was returned, alive and well enough to run around (but with amnesia- sort of), on **Thanksgiving morning**- the same morning a balloon release was scheduled for a ""Bring Sherri Home"" gathering, and everybody there supposedly had their phones ringing with news of her homecoming minutes after the balloons were released.

SP has prior documentation of extreme behavior including blaming self harm on others, kicking down doors, stealing from family.

SP never made any statements unlike all other recovered people that were kidnapped, tortured and lived to TELL about it. Examples- Elizabeth Smart, Jaycee Duggard, Amanda Barry and the 2 other girls Gina and (forgive me,   No good with names) and many others.

Why would they have left those things on her?  It seems like these abductors were careful in their actions, enough to not get caught, and it appears they had thought a lot of things out- they made sure to always have SP's face covered or their own faces covered for 3 whole weeks to the point that they could not be fully recognized, they made sure to speak Spanish the whole time so SP could not understand most of anything they said for that 3 week period, they made the burned message on her illegible so it cannot even be identified by LE, they fed and hydrated her enough to keep her alive for 3 weeks, they made her shower (possibly to remove any trace of themselves from her person) and they put a different set of clothes on her (again to possibly remove all trace of themselves, though they dropped the ball there by leaving a little male dna somehow.)  So, why would they not remove the chains and clamps too, and risk the possibility of somehow those items being traced back to them?  If they were so careful to make sure there was no way they could be tracked down or identified, how could they have overlooked that part of it?  So I guess my point is that, to me, even the fact that she was wearing the chains and clamps when she was found seems kind of over the top, as if the abductors were making a point to prove that she really was being held somewhere by someone. 

Also adding in to the weirdness is that she was dropped off at a location that she would be found fairly quickly right before the sun came up.  Wouldn't you think they would let her go on some out of the way back road in some remote location to give themselves more time to get away from the scene of the drop off and at a time during the night where it would be a while til she was found?  If someone had found her right away the person who left her on the side of the road very well could have had police on her tail if she didn't get away fast enough from that area.

Shortly thereafter it's discovered CG has a creepy video advertisement/business entitled Project Taken.

And just allll the CG/JG bs. In hindsight, it seems like some kind of a diversion tactic. It was all just too crazy and kooky at the time. It really seemed like a movie, a bad movie, was playing out- the Don Shipley videos, the shadowed AD, with a baseball cap on, no less. So much weirdness surrounding those two.

The iPhone app Keith used then discovering CG had a tip of the day using the find your missing wife app. If those two (CG/KP) didn't know each other prior, they had two glaring things in common (""coincidences"") right off the bat.

Everything is so unusual, strange pieces parallel each other which is what has kept me interested in this case's outcome.

13.Nov 16: Cameron met with Keith early in the morning to offer his support to the family and gain a better understanding of the details surrounding the case. Cameron shared with Keith how he believed this to be an abduction based on all the details he had seen up to this point, and was going to treat it as such until proved otherwise. Keith absolutely believed she was abducted as well. It was during this conversation that Keith told Cameron about the donor arriving later that night. He asked if Cameron if he would be willing to meet with the donor later in Sacramento, and drive him back to Redding from the airport. Cameron agreed. 

1.Nov 16: Cameron arrived at the Sacramento airport where he met the donor for the first time. The donor shared with Cameron his idea for a ransom reward. Cameron agreed it was an idea worth trying, but needed to make sure a few elements were changed in order to maximize the message to the abductor(s). During the course of their conversation the two of them discussed who the best spokesperson for the approach and the media would be. After hearing Cameron’s qualifications, and not wanting a family member to be at the forefront of the demands, the Donor suggested Cameron be the face of this offer and the person speaking directly to the captor(s).

2.Nov 16: Cameron and the Donor connected with Keith just before midnight to discuss the best course of action in moving forward. When it was presented to Keith that Cameron might be the best person to bring the message to the media, he was asked by Keith if he was comfortable with the risk of being known. Cameron told Keith that he would discuss it with his family, but was willing to do whatever it took to help Sherri and bring her home. 

3.Nov 16: Cameron and the Donor work most of the way through the night to edit and revamp the letter to reflect the new details of what needed to be said.

Didn't this happen a day or 2 before the thanksgiving miracle?  Wasn't that when the reward for her release was changed to a reward for their arrest?

I would suppose that, if CG picked the AD up from the airport, he would have to deliver him back.  Supposed CG coincidentally made a trip back to Sacramento just before she was released.  If it was a conspiracy those Sacramento trips would provide cover for him meeting with his operatives planning the release.  Nah!  That would just be too big of a conspiracy to believe.

Here are some of my thoughts regarding this.  The various agencies/professionals and inner-family members have more knowledge than we do.  The 'agencies/professionals' dealing with her are LE (i.e. SCSO, FBI, etc) and representation (like that publicity agent from So Cal).  And then there are Inner Circle-Family members which include KP, RR, SK, LG, RG.. et al (...who will all most likely be meeting up this Thurs for Thanksgiving by the way).  All of these 'groups' know more than we do...and my feeling (IMO) is that they all knew about MM way.. way back (at the beginning).  I also believe that the inner circles know that her withdrawing $ 1200 cash to supposedly pay bills was out of the norm also.  Why withdraw cash?...so you can pay the local general store for provisions and supplies (tack, dried buffalo jerky, bottles of sasparilla, and Robusta coffee beans)?  Here is what I think about that cash withdrawal.  CamGam reported to us all first that SP withdrew $ 1200 cash two days before she disappeared.  CG said that she used part of the cash to pay DayCare and the remainder was left on the bedroom dresser (this makes sense since it was the end of the month and being in Redding...kind of in the sticks...I can imagine a local day care not being licensed ....or they were licensed but did not have a bank account and could only take cash).   Now, what was the monthly charge for DayCare....was it $ 300 per month?  If so, this means that there should have been $ 900 cash still in the wallet on top of the dresser...right? This is another thing that only LE (inner circles) know ...and we ...the public don't.   What we don't know is ......was DayCare typically paid by SP with cash?  Did SP actually pay Daycare that month with cash?  (she would have had only 2 days to do this....the entire day of Nov 1st and the morning of Nov 2nd).  But let's say SP did pay Daycare with part of the $ 1200 cash on Nov 1st or Nov 2nd (whatever the amount was).....SP might has used part of this cash for her getaway.  (Example:  Day care was actually only $ 100....$ 900 was still left in the wallet on the dresser.....leaving $ 200 cash for her getaway).  Or....the cash withdrawal of $ 1200 was an entire 'ruse' and she had been 'ratholing' cash for a couple of months and had more cash at her disposal than LE or family members could track.  I digressed on the cash thing there....back to the main topic............. The question is then...what has SP told LE and her trusted 'inner circle' about MM.  Did she tell them ""Oh, I am sorry....MM was nothing...I've been so bored since I was laid off from AT&T and Keith is gone at work everyday...the only time I was happy is when I picked the kids up from DayCare and when the weekends or holidays came around.....MM was just a distraction from my daily boredom"". The people/groups dealing with her and who questioned her might have bought this story.  But then we come around to the fact that she was close to actually meeting MM and within days of possibly meeting MM, she goes on one of her supposedly ""I just started running again"" runs and low and behold.....on one of these runs....she is ""TAKEN"".  Here is what I think and have always thought.....she planned her 'getaway'.   She secretly withdrew little bits of cash over a long period of time to have ready for her getaway.  And 2 days prior to her disappearance, she withdrew $ 1200 cash...possibly really did pay Daycare....left the remaining cash in the wallet on the dresser for the sole purpose of making KP think that if there was cash still in the wallet (on the bedroom dresser) that she had no reason to be needing cash while going for a run.....if the cash is still in the wallet.....she didn't go away voluntarily.....but she did go away voluntarily and that my friends....that is how it happened.

Carrie was a 49-year old pregnant woman who went missing the day she was scheduled for a C-section birth.  Her adult daughter was picking her up to drive her to the hospital and Carrie just disappeared. She was found a few days later, no longer pregnant. There was a pretty intense search for her because it was a risky pregnancy.  Turns out that she had faked her pregnancy and was about to be exposed. 

Her brother, who had some damn common sense, made a statement to the public. He thanked everyone, explained that she had some issues, and asked for privacy. Without going into great detail, he conveyed the idea that she had some mental health issues.  Because he TOLD THE TRUTH, people accepted it and were understanding. I don’t think she faced any charges.

Interestingly, the internet doesn’t have many results for this story, although it was big enough at the time for this local mystery to have made it to the news in my area. Maybe the family had the story scrubbed.  As someone who followed it, it’s okay, because maybe it should be put to rest. Everyone is okay, and this sick woman deserves to work out her issues in peace.

Remember, the Sheriff did release expense reports that showed their office traveled to Woodland on December 17, 2016 to investigate.  So why did they wait 3 weeks after she was found down there, to go back there and look around if they really had solid proof she was held there all that time?  And if Keith and the rest of the family also knew she was held in that area, then why didn't they make repeated trips down there to find the kidnappers?  I know I would have done it if it was mu wife.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4873826/Sherri-Papini-seen-picking-children-Redding-CA.html


But if the investigators knew she was taken 2.5 hours away the first day- then why wasn't there more of a presence with numerous investigators going literally door to door in Yolo county looking for evidence.  In fact - unless Sherri knew she was going south, then the only route she could have been on that goes 2.5 hours non-stop would be I-5 and that goes north, too.  Wouldn't the Sheriff want to go to the Medford OR area and check there as well?

BUT - again, the only trips they made were to Williams on December 15 then to Woodland on December 17.  So I think they were looking for the ""holding cell""-house with the toilet - but they didn't find it.  In fact, why are they not there still going door to door? Why aren't the media, the Daily Mail, CrimeWatchOnline etc - down there in Woodland or Yolo trying to find more evidence?"|6||||0||1511356158.0|0|||False|0|6|"Her ""Abductors"" drove her about 2 1/2 hours non-stop the first day."|23|https://i.redditmedia.com/saHkyCRw0XKLHtt6nBqdIXtzCUFIE3saGMNDsXUUVjw.jpg?s=045f5f34667a038b022e48085992901c

KP already had a suspicion of it or she might even have told him in an argument.

So MM man is going to fly into Sacramento instead of San Francisco and rent a car, drive to San Francisco, attend his conference and then drive back to Woodland the afternoon of the 2nd.

SP had made arrangements to have Los Ubers pick her up around 2, down at the mailboxes, and drive the 2 1/2 hours to their Woodland hotel.

MM had to change his plans and fly immediately home because of a ""family emergency"".  Translate: His wife found out.  How?  Did KP call her and tell her that afternoon that his wife was meeting her husband that evening in a Woodland hotel?   Then she called him and told him that, If he wasn't on the next plane, there was going to be a divorce and he could live in a hotel permanently.

So KP having spoiled the aspiring couple's chances for a 1 night romance and copulation, and noting that she had already left, decided to call the cops.

Then she realized that MM was gone and she couldn't go home that night decided to stay.  Or she might have accompanied him to the airport, hence her rumored sighting there.  He went back to Detroit, but she didn't, hence the cops thought she might have traveled there enough that they sent 2 cops out there looking for her.

But, no, she remembered some friends in Woodland, maybe not the best people, but they would let her crash for sure.

As for your theory, well, it certainly is a scenerio that connects all the dots.  And probably a little more plausible than my wild 'abducted by aliens and wiped of her memory' theory.  :)

I just don't know.  I think if she was out in the public too much, like at a hotel or at the airport, there would have been more of a chance of people seeing her.  I definitely think MM fits into this whole 3 week disappearance thing somehow, the timing of their planned meeting/cancellation is just too coincidental.  And I think it's possible that she and KP could have had some kind of argument that morning, which somehow plays into her disappearance.  It's just hard to figure she'd hold out on coming back for 3 weeks.  But I agree that it does make sense she was in Woodland- the timing and everything seems to fit that scenario.  If LE is suspicious that she may have been in Woodland, would the SCSO still be the ones investigating that or would it pass to another jurisdiction?

If he called 911 and said his wife was missing an hour after he should have found her at home and she wasn't there, I'm not sure that LE would take that too seriously.  They certainly wouldn't put out an all points bulletin.

He mentions the phone in his first statement and then goes into detail in his second statement.  The phone is what reinforces his reason for being freaked out after he can't locate his wife who could just be an hour behind schedule for lots of reasons.

""I hit like the Find My iPhone app thing""

This statement has bothered me.  This is a tech guy but he is making it sound like he is some average non-tech savvy person who just remembers that he has this app thing that might find his wife's phone.  He is trying to throw the operator off from the fact that he is very technical and tracks his wife constantly and she really freaked him out when she left her phone so he couldn't track her.

I think she may have stuck it in the mailbox when she was picked up or left it in her car.

So many good points, questions on this thread.

One thing that I didn't see mentioned that always baffled me (besides EVERYTHING else) is......

Why would KP go search by the mailboxes at all, immediately? I wouldn't track my spouse period unless hours went by but if I did I would see they were by the mailboxes and I would assume they walked to grab the mail and were probably chatting with a friend/neighbor by the mailboxes, maybe the kids were playing getting tired out for dinner, bath and beddie bye

If they didn't come home within I don't know 15 minutes maybe... I'd get in my own car or whatever car was ""hot"" (but I leave in the midwestern tundra so we always go for the most warmed up vehicle) and then I'd go look.

I grew up in a very rural place where mailboxes where far away too, sometimes it was the most exiting thing our day to walk down (or ride bikes) to the mailbox to get the mail. If a neighbor drove by they would most likely stop (close community) if it was a locale we didn't know they would just drive by and wave but 9 out of 10 times an hour long conversation about the damn gophers/sparrows/pests in general ruining crops or gardens would ensue. Point is mailboxes tend to be somewhat of attraction in rural areas and not unusual for a trip to the mailbox to take some time especially if it's a mile (15 minute walk each way) away "|9||||0||False|0|||False|0|9|When Exactly Did KP Begin To 'Freak Out' On 11/2/16?|93|

I could swear I recall seeing a picture of the phone as KP alleges he found it. IIRC, it appeared to be daylight out in the picture I recall seeing shortly after the story broke last year. It was what 6 or 630 when he called LE and presumably shortly after or immediately after he allegedly found her phone. The time had jumped back an hour before then so it would’ve been dark by then. Is it possible he discovered her phone hours before making the call?

I worked in a daycare and I always thought it was highly unlikely that he was the one to call the daycare about the kids being picked up.  They more than likely would have called whoever is on the emergency contact/authorized pick up list.  

I posted about this somewhere else recently, but the timeline of things according to KP has always sounded totally off.  One of the things that bothered me was when he was talking to the 911 operator in his initial call, he told her that SP had not picked up the kids from daycare and that made him think something was wrong.  When the operator asked him about the kids he said he was going to call his mom to pick them up.  So he talked to the daycare before he made the 911 call, he knew the kids were still there, it was right before 6pm when he called 911 and the kids still weren't picked up and he had not made any arrangements yet for them to be picked up.  I don't understand that.  How long was the daycare expected to hold on to the kids?  From what he was saying to the operator he was driving back and forth from the driveway to the mailboxes in SP's car while on the 911 call, tying to figure out where SP was.  I would think he would have rushed to get the kids as soon as he found out they were still at the daycare.

I have a hard time believing the day care hadn't notified anyone by 5:30, especially if she was always home with the kids when HE got home. And that day he got home late.

I can not understand why he did not drive towards the daycare to see if she was on her way there. Why wasn't his first thoughts along the line of ""I hope nothing happened to her while she was going to get the kids""? 

A normal reaction is one where you hear that your kids were not picked up like normal and think what happened to the Mrs.? Did she get a flat tire or have a blowout? Did the alternator go? OMG! Did she get into an accident? Is she stuck somewhere?

Then you drive the normal route to the daycare. Humans are creatures of habit, we pretty much take the same routes to work, to school, to the store even. He would know how she normally went. Why didn't he drive that way and check for her then get the kids? Freak out once you know it isn't a simple issue.

Maybe he justifies 911 and getting a search party because he wants to believe she’s in danger or suicidal because she couldn’t possibly leave the kids.

What gives? KP had to pass the mailboxes when he came in or no? So his wife and/or kids could have just been out for a little walk and went by the mailboxes on the way back to the house to see daddy who just got home from work and have a normal evening.

It's not uncommon for evening walks especially with little kids it calms them down and tires them/gets their appetite up for dinner. If it was me and my spouse took the kids out for nice walk I would be ecstatic! Not that I don't love my family but it's nice when they get exercise and outdoor time and I get a chance to take off work clothes and get in my sweats! 

Geez my story would have made me look bad as hell-

""Well they weren't home so I didn't call because if I did they would rushed home and I wanted a chance to change out of work clothes. Then I went to the fridge and I cracked open a cold one. Then I sat down with my beer and got on reddit. When I finished my beer I realized it was 6 pm and I was hungry so I called my husband because I wanted some dinner. Then they didn't answer so I figured they were having fun, so I ate some chips and salsa to hold me over.

I have one article saying SCSO requested the change on the 12th, 

>""Shasta County sheriff’s officials don’t know why the California Department of Justice identifies local missing woman Sherri Papini as someone who left her family, and they’ve asked the agency to change the “voluntary missing adult” classification assigned to her.""

Then on the 13th, there was this saying it had been changed:

>""Last week, the California Department of Justice classified Papini as a “voluntary missing adult” on its online database, meaning she was someone who left of her own free will. Her family and local law enforcement has asked that the status be changed. The DOJ has since updated the status with a “suspicious circumstances” label and not the “missing at risk” label the Shasta County Sherrif’s Office has used since she was first reported missing on Nov. 2.""

November 13th is also the day they hired a private investigator.

I know they can be faked and aren't reliable etc. but the fact that he apparently asked if he could take it and did it so willingly makes me feel like he was being honest **at that moment** about what he knew.  


However!  We know that LE flew to Michigan around the time that he took that test, which means they probably knew about the texts between SP and MM before the polygraph was administered.  Did KP know about those texts at that point? And if so, did that have any influence on what they asked him?  Let's assume for a moment that KP did know about the text messages between SP and MM when he took the polygraph.  If that were the case, the questions could be along the lines of:



* Did you kill your wife?
* Did you physically harm your wife in any way?
* Did you have anything to do with your wife's disappearance?
* Do you know where your wife is?
* Did your wife tell you she was leaving?
* Do you believe your wife left her family voluntarily?
* Did you know of any plans to meet up with another man?
* Did you arrange to have your wife harmed?
* Do you know anyone in Michigan?
* Are you a robot?


Of course I have no idea what questions they asked or what he did or didn't know at the time but that might change the line of questioning.  The goal was to establish whether or not he harmed her, so by saying he passed and was not a suspect, it really just means they found him truthful when he said he didn't harm or kill her or know where she was.  For all we know he may not have passed some of the questioning, just the important stuff.

Here is some more commentary from KP that I think has some telling pieces of information: 

-“She is my wife, and I know everything about her,” Keith says. “I know that my wife would never leave me and never in a million years leave our kids.”

-Keith believes his wife “would have to have been either snuck up on, or there would have been multiple or maybe two people, because my wife is very aware. She wouldn’t have allowed somebody to get that close to her unless it was unsuspecting”

-The abductor, he says, is probably a stranger: “My gut says it is a person unknown to myself and Sherri. My gut tells me it is just low-life people.”

-""Low-life people""??  Seriously?  Your wife was abducted while running..uggghhh... ""Low-life"" is a little weak don't ya think Keith?   That's what you call someone who breaks into your car and steals your stereo, steals your kids bike, spray paints graffiti, etc, etc ..lol.. not someone who freaking abducts your wife!   And already, he knows it's more then one?  What are the odds?  I mean, how many women are abducted while jogging by more then one ""low life""?

I pondered that set up as well. 

As a mother and wife I don't always feel appreciated as much as I'd like (I like consistent affirmation, to a fault) but I'm reminded on the occasion where I work late or on weekends how much I am missed even for a few hours. When daddy is gone no one bats an eyelash, they do ask when he's coming home. But when I'm gone, I see faces in the window when I pull to up the house, they are waiting for me. 

Makes me a little emotional just thinking about my kids, and SP kids. I feel kind of sad when I see that they missed me but it also makes me feel good about our bond and that my presence is wanted/needed.

I'm glad the P kids were still young when this happened but either they were missing their mother terribly or they weren't because they aren't fully bonded with her. Either way is heartbreaking. I just hope they have a lot of love and care around them.

>Papini: Give me one second. … She sent me a text at 10:47 asking me if I was coming home for lunch, from work. And I said, “Sorry, long day.” And that was the last — I never spoke to her on the phone or had any other contact with her.

>http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/25/sherri-papini-abduction-911-audio-sketches-released/

KP statement in and interview with ABC news published Nov 7, 2016:

>“I received a text message from her at 10:37 a.m. that day asking me if I was coming home for lunch,” Keith Papini said. “I usually don’t bring my personal phone in on my job. So I didn’t respond to that message until 1:39 p.m. that day.” 

>http://abcnews.go.com/US/husband-missing-california-mom-sherri-papini-thinks-abducted/story?id=43348426

This was the interview done on Sunday just 4 days after she went missing where he made the statement. He was definitely trying to establish the ""Taken"" theme by that time:

>“Everybody who knows my wife knows that there’s no reason for her to leave ... She was definitely taken against her will,” Keith Papini told ABC News in a Sunday interview. 

Also was this the first time the ""Just Bring Her Home"" vs ""Please Just release her"" or ""Please let her go"" theme was used. :

>“She has a family that loves her. Please just bring her home,” said her sister, Sheila Koester.

KP was on the same page in the inside edition interview probably on the same day:

>""Bring her home, bring her home, just bring her home,"" a distraught Keith Papini told KRCR-TV. ""Bring her home safe. There is a $50,000 reward. Just bring her home.""

Bertain, was telling the family that he thought she was voluntarily missing.  Of course Bertain was reading her texts and probably had other evidence that she was planning to leave.  He was also talking with people from the past like ""TrumpIsCrazy"", her ex, and ""other people from her past"" as well as Michigan Man and he decided to send a couple of cops to investigate MM in the suburban Detroit area.

And we do know as fact from Sgt. Jackson's recent statement that she had been texting MM for some time and had been planning to meet him when he was in California and that only didn't happen because MM had a ""family emergency"", which probably meant that his wife discovered his plan.

Edit Additional:  It seems like Bertain and KP and the family were on the same page that she was alive and probably out of the area.  They just differed on whether it was voluntary or she had been ""Taken"".  A lot of KP being invested in and selling the ""she was taken"" theme was either to force her home or defend her honor or telegraph to her that she could come home not shamed as a two timing wife but as a victim of a horrible abduction.

I think when he came home and found her gone and the kids not picked up he had strong emotions about who she might be with mixed with a lot of fear.   He jumped to the conclusion that she had been ""taken"" when there could have been a lot of other explanations for her having been delayed.

Of course her phone is crucial to him calling 911 and hoping they would take him seriously.  Without the phone being left in the grass, her running and hour late without explanation wouldn't be deemed a serious.  Did he plant it?  Was it in her car?  Mailbox?  Maybe she just decided to take a ride with someone and put the phone in the mailbox as she knew KP would be sitting in his work van plotting her whereabouts on his laptop.

Why did he reinforce that she had just taken up running again?  Wouldn't it be more likely she just decided to take a stroll down to pick up the mail? 

Once the cops were involved and then it became a local woman hunt and then a national woman hunt, there was no turning back.

The only way she could come home was to fill out the abduction script.  Need a few bruises, throw in a crude brand, and some props.  How about a chain and some hose clamps?  And then there had to be some abductors in the story.  Couldn't be a guy as that would raise lots of other issues.  How about those Latino women from my old Skinheadz story.  I could even have beat one up trying to escape.

The account still exists, but it's private now. https://imgur.com/a/fsyyk

It's strange that she interacted with the seemingly fake KP & SP accounts. With all of the drama on the internet that the Papinis have had, you'd think that LJ would double check with them to make sure those accounts belong to them. Or, maybe she's not as close to them as is made out. 

I don't think that the SP and KP accounts are real. For argument's sake - is it possible that the accounts actually belonged to them, Twitter asked for verification and they just didn't send anything in?

I concur with everything written! I too would gladly align with SP and support her instead of being part of the categorized, “armchair detectives” or “online critical mean people”.  

Here’s my story and I hope it can encourage you to step into the light, out of the fringes.  Fear can consume us.  Face it head on, even if your entanglement in the story has some guilt. Forgive yourself.  Everyone else will follow.  I am not sure if fear of the kidnappers (who aren’t exactly 2 Hispanic Women or maybe they are and of the La Eme variety)... Almost 3 years ago my now ex husband robbed a bank and I knew when it came up on news.  When I refused to provide an alibi, he tried to choke me and kill me. Police came. Didn’t believe me about bank and classified it as DV.  My ex husband engaged in a war of fear inducing antics making my life a mere game to him. I had exit strategies for every possible entrance in my home and work, changed my driving patterns every day, trained in Krav Maga, remained hyper vigilant of my surroundings. I knew the police shift change times and typical response time depending on day and time of week.  I learned any man who goes for your neck means business.  I learned that nearly all DV victims who are murdered had previously told someone they had been choked.  It was an awful way to live.  Actually it wasn’t living.  It was responding to fear.  

359 days later, a friend was kidnapped, raped, sodomized, and escaped, when in a haze she texted me.  I went to her in minutes.  When I saw her, she had been beaten black and blue.  Nose broken.  Eyes swollen.  Zip ties so tight around her wrists that her hands were purple.  Zip ties on her ankles tightly bound.  But when I saw the ligature marks on her neck, that’s when I went into survival mode.  You see she knew her abductor. He had let her take a walk not knowing I went to her.  And everything I had prepared for with my ex husband, I realized had been to prepare me for that moment.  I knew Police could be there within 5-6 minutes on a good day, 8 minutes  if across town.  We didn’t have 3 minutes to get to safety.  I heard someone coming and immediately scanned the environment for a weapon and then to shelter in place.  It wasn’t him.  I can still remember the sound of howling wind outside and smell of pine tree (it was day after Christmas).  I knew the abductor was going to finish the job murdering my friend and I was just collateral damage... There’s a point I swear.  

I trained for almost a year for someone I deathly feared.  That fear consumed me.  After helping my friend immediately get to safety, I changed my approach to life.

You see, I actually put into my google alerts “bank robbery” and my city the night my ex husband came to get our dog.  Surely enough that google alert went off that night.  People are very predictable— especially brazen, egotistical criminals.    I used my ex husband’s predictability to turn the tables.

It’s called “I am Elizabeth Smart”. I read and watched interviews leading up to the film release and Ms. Smart reportedly gave every detail that was depicted. 
Her memory was THAT good. At 14-years old she recalls instances with such clarity and almost down to the day it happened. She was raped daily for nearly 9 months. She was truly starved and not given water and chained up. 
She was psychologically tormented. 

But Sherri can’t remember a thing? Nothing? Her friends and family defend her loss of memory because she was abused and tormented. One would think a 34 year old woman and mother of two would AT LEAST have the ability and resiliency to match that of a 14-year old innocent girl with no life experience. To be fair, Elizabeth Smart is a remarkable human being.

Likely the court will issue the summary judgement against the Gs in the next couple of months.  It could be a whopper.

Because the Gs obviously didn't buy that renter's insurance, they don't have protection or the benefit of the insurance company's lawyer.  They obviously didn't feel they could hire a lawyer themselves to defend them.

My guess is that Roles is the landlord of CG, otherwise, if CG owned the property, he could simply take out a loan to pay for the lawsuit.

I agree, I just wonder if he might be motivated to help camgam with the whole conspiracy depending on what their relationship is like.
permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold
[–]donotlizard 3 points 11 months ago 
I think that the fact that Roles's lawyers are not representing the Gambles defies that logic. But perhaps that may change in future court filings.
permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold
[–]muwtskiMonk Robe Master 4 points 11 months ago 
Probably. I believe Roles is represented by an attorney that works for State Farm, so he's probably a lot smarter than Gamble in most ways. I haven't really thought this stuff through a whole lot, the lawsuit etc. so I'm just kind of running my mouth. This thread is really the first time I really even thought of it being a potential motive.

I thought he was CG's landlord and owns the ""ranch"" CG was renting - could be wrong. Looks like he had insurance that's why and insurance lawyer is representing him. Normally homeowners or rental insurance would cover liability for your dogs but apparently CG wasn't covered.

My advice would be to ask for an appointment with LE to tell the whole story, but sit down with your family first and explain to them what really happened, how this situation came to be, why you did not or could not return or contact them, give them a sincere and heartfelt apology for any breach of trust, and ask for their forgiveness."|8||||0||False|0|||False|0|8|Early Family Anger|41|https://i.redditmedia.com/F5W-Mr1EGZQirZX6XTwtDoQsYak0Ys3X6jbQGTSpUtw.jpg?s=0872cd2ccd7867c8f0a10934b6c4d29e

.

There are moments in life that define you. Moments that test the truest of hearts and the integrity of who you claim to be. These moments are never easy and they seldom come without backlash. But that happens because these moments are the what separates a hero from the rest.
.

This man is a hero. He has committed his life to helping others. Without recognition, without the spotlight, and sometimes without a thank you. But he continues without hesitation, without wavering and without letting the opinions of others distract him from his mission.
.

A year ago he was asked to help in a helpless situation. l remember him coming home to me and asking what l thought he should do. Without hesitation l told him that if l was ever in a situation like this, l would pray that someone like him would help me.
.

It wasn’t conventional. It wasn’t easy. It required a lot of risk and sacrificed a lot of what we had built for our lives...but, it was a matter of saving a life.
.

And that is what he did. Regardless of how it was spun. Regardless of the backlash. Regardless of the lies and propaganda that was spread...at the end of the day this man did G O O D. At the end of the day, we wouldn’t change a change thing. We stand confidently in the truth and will be thankful for the day that truth is revealed.
.

Sometimes in life you will be faced with a situation that will require every part of you, every ounce of courage and every bit of your heart. These are the defining moments in your life, don’t run from them.
.

Friends, you can’t be all the good the world needs. But the world needs all the good you can be."""|9||||0||False|0|||False|0|9|Solving Super-Mom’s Sabbatical|37|

I’ve followed along more closely since this last release. The language they use is very telling and almost empty. It’s been stated numerous times that the family was trying to convince the public of what they wanted them to believe about SP. All I really recall hearing from them was how she was a “super mom” but no real evidence to back it up - so simply making generic statements about her (which is what you mentioned). 

What made her a “super mom”? Did she care for the kids, have Pinterest worthy meals ready 3 times a day every day, volunteer during the times the kids were in day care, keep a spotless home, actively participate in her parish, etc. I think they were and are trying to convince the public and themselves of what they’d like for SP to be. Based on the information that’s been shared here, I think SP is just your typical average mom and there is nothing wrong with that. 

I can see how they’d be trying to overcompensate for her past shortcomings. One of the things I forget occasionally is the area really does resemble the south a lot where honor is heavily valued (honor = the perception others have of you). Keeping that in mind, I can understand how a drug problem, running away, extramarital affairs, etc. would be a problem for them. I still believe this was a hoax orchestrated by SP & KP. I believe they thought everything SP stated would be taken at face value and when that didn’t happen, the flaws in their plan became increasingly obvious. I certainly don’t think they anticipated this level of scrutiny and living in a small town would compound all of these issues since there is no real possibility for anonymity in the way someone might have if they lived in a place like NYC or Chicago.

Both words are problematic for me. ""Our""? I don't personally know this woman, never will. I sort of get it if the family feels this way, but then they should call her ""our sherri"" privately. I've long followed the Kyron Horman case and they don't call him ""our boy"", they say Kyron.   I feel so much for him, and it's such a sad case (one that I truly hope gets solved someday. Soon!!!). Anyway, my point here is that they didn't have to force my emotions, sympathy and beliefs about the case by calling him ""our boy "".
Second, why call her a girl? She's a grown woman! I'm a few years older than her and it would really bother me if someone called me a girl. I have little girls and and I would only call someone a girl if she was! Not a woman who's 20, and certainly not someone in her 30's... who's a mother! To a girl!
Keith seems really bizarre to me. The whole family, but him especially. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something's off.

Also, I just have to chime in with the supermom thing. I personally think supermoms are a myth. A socially engineered myth of what the supposed perfect mother looks like and does. I'm a mother, I try very hard to be a very good one, but I'm human and I make mistakes. I apologize to my children when I get grumpy or yell. The stepford wife/June cleaver mother is weird and not possible. Put simply, as a stay at home mother, you absolutely do need time for self care, and a little bit of time to yourself everyday just to keep going, so you can stay sane and feel normal! I've never had a problem with SP's kids in daycare because I get it. I have 3 very young children, one of whom is in all day preschool, and while I only get 2.5 hours to myself twice a week (when youngest is in daycare), I understand if someone gets more help. It is so isolating being a stay at home mom! There are some days when my only conversation with an adult is the brief chat at, say, the grocery checkout. I get bored (not of the kids, but the housework. At the same time, I like the house clean/cleanish...).  I need exercise and a creative outlet (like most everybody) and believe me, if I could afford a little more daycare, I probably would take it so I could spend time on fulfilling my creative dreams. It's good! No mom needs to be only a mom. You'd probably go bonkers. Sometimes the laundry and endless chores really get to me, and I watch YouTube videos on science just to keep my brain from becoming mush. I love being a mom; I do not love feeling like a housecleaner. 

Last comment: all of the moms I've known who either tried to present themselves as supermoms,  or whose families idealized them as such,  were, behind closed doors, not supermoms. They had needs to look perfect, to seem like they had it all. Narcissism? And they all had stories about their parenting that they would prefer no one to know (like yelling, spanking, benign neglect). This is why I take time for self care. You can't take care of others if you don't take care of yourself. When I see or hear that someone's a supposed supermom, red flags go off for me (or whatever the idiom is. Sorry, brain fog. Was up half the night with a sick child)."|12||||0||1511111103.0|0|||False|0|12|So a question about language|49|

Like the elephant in the room, based on her past behaviors.  More than likely, Keith has found out about some of her previous side dudes.  There's no way he hasn't!
After she disappeared, they knew she'd be following  the news, so they used the ""super mom"" card and that creepy language (""our girl"") as a way to guilt trip her.  Maybe even ""mock"" the persona they knew Sherri tried to portray.  They all knew the real Sherri vs. Pinterest Sherri.  
Keith just seems like a psychopath, so whatever he could say to convince her to come back, they can deal with the cheating/leaving her family, later.  He would rather hide her affairs than look like a loser who lost his picture-perfect wife and picture-perfect family.  
I don't think he's been honest with his own family though.  Considering his mom's boyfriend is a prominant guy of Redding, and his mom has helped provide their family's picturesque lifestyle.  
As long as Keith has his girl back, he can keep controlling her, and that's all that matters.  Why won't everyone just forget about it already so we can go back to our Facebook-perfect-private lives?  /s

Because that's what you do.* We speak openly about it, sometimes abrasively, and I'm not afraid to address awkward secrets because...I guess I don't care? I have a point. 

My point is, my FIL says things that make him sound good. My MIL says things that make her sound like she doesn't need or want help. Both of them refer to each other by name. If anything happened to either of their children, grandchildren, whatever, NAME would be used. Pettiness aside. As much as my FIL's new wife hates his ex, and as much as my MIL hate's his new wife, there would still be a scene, for the children, for the family members, because you set that aside and humanize someone. Because a person is a person. And my MIL would never say, ""Well, this person is missing."" Because that person has children. She'd use a name. She might hate her for whatever reason, but she'd never refer to her as a thing. ""The mother of these children, my ex husbands....mother of children."" 

So the language to me is so baffling. How is everyone so calculated. It's like talking about chess if you were really into chess...like sexually

The way they talk about her like she is a little girl.  Even from the start when KP reacted the way he did to her being gone, it seemed more like the frantic actions of someone who's child disappeared.  As soon as he saw she was not there he immediately assumed 'someone grabbed her'.  He didn't even make arrangements to have the kids picked up first before calling to report her missing.  In the initial 911 call he told the operator that the daycare told him SP did not pick up the kids and then the operator asked him about the kids and he said he will call up his mom to pick them up.  It was around 6pm and the kids were still at the daycare waiting to be picked up?  I understand he was worried but you would think when the daycare told him the kids were still there his first thought was to pick up the kids or arrange for them to be picked up before trying to figure out what happened with SP.  In my mind, I would think that there could be other explanations for a grown adult to not be home- went to a store and lost track of time, got caught up in some traffic, decided to go to a friend's house, visiting a neighbor, maybe got hurt and is at the ER, etc.  But he seemed to jump right to ""someone took her"" as if there was no possible way she could have disappeared on her own.  When she appeared again it was her sister, who was weeks away from having a baby and did not need any more stress at that time, that got in front of the mic and faced a couple dozen questions.  Then it was KP who did the 20/20 interview.  He made her sound more like a child than ever when he did that.  It just rubbed me the wrong way when he rose his voice up several notches and imitated her saying ""It's Thanksgiving morning?""  Does she really speak like that?  Even now, a year later, she still has not said one word for herself to the public.  Even the thank you that was put out recently by their spokesperson was all said to have come from KP.  She could not even say thank you through their spokesperson?  It just appears like she is kept in this bubble and everyone is trying to shield her from the whole world.  They are making her appear weak instead of helping her be strong.  I think it would be in her best interest if everyone tried to help her face whatever she has to in order for the truth to be made known and their family can move on in life.

Moms forget to take care of themselves first far too often. Your post reminds me of when my older ones were all under 5 as well, and it was a lot of work and I just wanted a break every now and then. Any break at all! I worked ft most of it too. 

I can't count how many times I'd lock myself in the bathroom after being up and go go going for 12 hours, and cry the release of stress, because it took so much out of me to be ""ON"" all the time. Then I'd go make dinner, clean or whatever and just keep trudging forward until collapsing every night for a few hours.
It was mentally exhausting. By the time I had twins years later, my body was wrecked with illness and can't work anymore. 

*I didn't take enough time for myself.* Years and years of not enough sleep, food, vitamins, mental recuperation, and some lousy genetics all led to my body quitting early. 

What I have a hard time with is;

Calling her SuperMom, when she hardly seemed to fall into any category of ""doing it all"". 
Was she A 'S.A.H.S.M.' (stay at home super mom)? Usually picking them up by 4pm or so.....can happen every day, or 2x a week. I wish this info was concrete somewhere, but too many inconsistencies in the family's statements. And I think a few of them said she homeschooled too? Lol what? They were 2 and 4 last year, and obviously IN preschool/day care! Makes no sense.

If she was unable to care for them ft due to illness or depression and anxiety, it would clash with the story everyone sold. "|4||Moderator||0||False|0|||False|0|4|So a question about language|49|

In those cases, the nationwide publicity is what's relevant. Because they need to make examples of the person perpetrating the hoax or making the false report due to community outrage and the great expense in investigating that cases with national publicity tend to cause. 
Further, criminal conviction rates really aren't that relevant at all. That's because conviction rates for most criminal charges nationwide are low. The vast majority of cases are resolved via plea bargains:
""In 2013, while 8 percent of all federal criminal charges were dismissed (either because of a mistake in fact or law or because the defendant had decided to cooperate), more than 97 percent of the remainder were resolved through plea bargains, and fewer than 3 percent went to trial. The plea bargains largely determined the sentences imposed.
While corresponding statistics for the fifty states combined are not available, it is a rare state where plea bargains do not similarly account for the resolution of at least 95 percent of the felony cases that are not dismissed; and again, the plea bargains usually determine the sentences, sometimes as a matter of law and otherwise as a matter of practice. Furthermore, in both the state and federal systems, the power to determine the terms of the plea bargain is, as a practical matter, lodged largely in the prosecutor, with the defense counsel having little say and the judge even less.""

Which LE department am I speaking of? All. Nationwide. I can list all the cases of infamous false allegations and cite how they were all prosecuted for something related to the false reports. That will take some time. But I guess I will play. 

Thelma Williams, Ohio, charged with making false alarms after telling detectives that a masked man broke into her home this week, tying her up and cutting off her clothes. Police said she claimed the intruder used her phone to record the incident and posted it to her Facebook account.

Rogelio Andaverde, Texas, “We have people file false reports all the time, and we put them in jail for it,” Treviño told the Express-News. “But I've never had someone do it just to get out of the house.” Andaverde was charged with making a false report to police. He was released on $5,000 bail.

Jennifer Wilbanks, Georgia, the so-called runaway bride, faces one felony and one misdemeanor charge for making false statements to police after her April 26 disappearance just days before her impending wedding.

Breana Harmon, Texas, A young Texas woman who ran into a church half naked and claimed that she was raped has been indicted on multiple charges related to what turned out to be a hoax. On Wednesday, 19-year-old Breana Rachelle Harmon, also known as Breana Harmon Talbott, was indicted on two third-degree felony counts of tampering with physical evidence and a third-degree felony count of tampering with a government record. She has also been charged with a state-jail felony count of tampering with a government record, the Herald Democrat reports.

Ballon Boy hoax, California, On October 18, Larimer County sheriff Jim Alderden announced his conclusion that the incident was a hoax and that the parents would likely face several felony charges.[10][11] Richard Heene pleaded guilty on November 13, 2009, to the charge of attempting to influence a public servant. On December 23, 2009, Richard Heene was sentenced to 90 days in jail and Mayumi Heene to 20 days of weekend jail;[12] Richard was also ordered to pay $36,000 in restitution.[13] He has since claimed to have pled guilty under duress.
Yasmin Seiwed, New York, An 18-year-old Muslim woman who claimed that three men attacked her on a Manhattan subway this month and tried to pull off her hijab was charged on Wednesday with filing a false report, the police said.

Ashley Todd, Pennsylvania, claimed a black Obama supporter mugged her and carved a B on her cheek, Todd was charged with filing a false police report, a misdemeanor charge with a maximum jail sentence of two years.

Meh. I change my mind, It would take too much time listing each nationwide, infamous false police report case and how they ALL ended up with charges. Perhaps you could do the opposite and list one nationwide case that didn't result in charges to the person making the false report? 

This is a massive case. There is no way in hell that they're holding back in charging her because the criminal conviction rate in general for false police reports is low. "|4||||0||False|0|||False|0|4|So a question about language|49|

Some of us do goof around a bit, but I try to keep my goofs to basic ribbings (I've probably failed at that a few times) and I usually do that toward the men.  I will say I think the people who want to attack SP's or other's appearance are out of line, that includes whether or not she has hair extensions or breast implants. 



I know some of the more well-meaning folks in here probably slip a bit sometimes, we all became fascinated about this story for various reasons and we just hope for new information and a resolution, and when those things don't come we might get a little carried away with ourselves.  It's not that we are entitled to this information, but its human nature I think. The desire to see something resolved, combined with the desire to be right.


What is funny about the majority of this group though is that we all probably feel like we almost know SP by now, and should she ever show up here I think she would be treated well by most.  In fact, I will go out on a limb and say there are quite a few people who would empathize with her on various levels.  There are a lot of people in here with a lot of experiences, and as I said before if we ever find out that it was in fact a hoax, I would completely respect her if she said ""well, I just lost my shit one day..."" because frankly that can happen to a lot of people for a variety of reasons."|16||||0||False|0|||False|0|16|I’d love to chat.

The most famous case of that is Richard Nixon's fall because of the Watergate coverup.  Currently there is a lot of this going on with all of the disclosures of public men acting inappropriately or even criminally with women.

I think there are definitely at least 6 stages to get through these things:

1.  Coming to grips with the reality of your situation and owning your culpability in it.

2.  Completely disclosing exactly what happened, what led up to it, your culpability in it, and why you weren't honest or completely forthcoming at the time.  This can be embarrassment, fear, dishonesty or whatever it was.

3.  A sincere and deep felt apology to all person's affected or those harmed, especially family members and people who trusted you.

4.  A willingness to accept the consequences of your actions.

5.  A willingness and determination to make amends.

6.  What you have learned from this, your personal growth, and your determination to lead an honest and productive life and do everything you can to help others.  

I'm sure there is more, but this basic framework can carry you through the process and you can have a happy and successful life on the other side if you are brave enough to take this path.

Just those words alone will generate sympathy from most people who read/hear them.  As more people involved in this case had put themselves in the public spotlight, their words and actions/inactions are what caused the skepticism and scrutiny.  As time went on and more details came to light, instead of gaining the favor that was being sought, the people who stood in Sherri's defense only managed to make the whole situation appear unbelievable.  Nothing made any sense at all.  The dark cloud that has formed over this whole case over time has been due to the peculiar way it has been presented and due to the omission of clarifying information that would have produced more empathy from the public.  From the start when the fact that SP was missing was highlighted in the media, the public was invested in this woman and her family.  When she reappeared, it was not only under highly suspicious circumstances, but the lack of urgency on the part of law enforcement and the family was just plain bizarre.  For three solid weeks the family, friends and law enforcement officials were urging the public to be invested in their situation and bringing all kinds of attention to their plight, and then in the blink of an eye they all cut off the public completely as soon as she reappeared.  There was no urgent plea for the public to help find the abductors, no warning of danger to those in the immediate area or to the general public at all.  If they really believed her story as they say they did, how do they justify not putting out crucial information to the people they are obligated to protect and serve?  If they were not getting enough information from SP, why not tell people that.  Instead they let their almost year long silence turn those who wanted to see SP recover from what supposedly was a horrible ordeal to allowing a huge amount of room for suspicion and doubt to enter in.  The only information that was volunteered was from Keith in his media interview and he seemed more focused on trying to praise his wife and in being mysterious than to offer any kind of information that would help anyone else or seek any kind of justice for what she went through.  I believe that the questions being asked on here by everyone do not come from a group of devious minds or a desire to rip someone apart- the questions come from a person's common sense looking at the big picture and at the individual details and knowing things do not add up.  Even those in LE have been forthcoming enough to admit that they understand why people have doubts and think it sounds like a hoax.  How can anyone, even the P's fiercest defenders, not understand why it appears sketchy?  How can you blame people for asking questions?

I have said this before.  I am not a hard person to convince.  If SP really was taken and harmed by anyone then my wishes and prayers for her are to recover from her ordeal, both physically and mentally, and move forward with her life and her family.  I would just like to see some courtesy and appreciation extended toward the public who became invested in her and prayed for her and who still cares enough to want to see justice served, however that may play out, in this case.  

It's a shame that there are so many people who come on here and work so hard to defend Sherri's public image and seem to focus on all the things they find offensive, but they fail to see that there are many highly intelligent minds on this sub who, if can be convinced that SP really was abducted, could use their efforts on her behalf.  Wouldn't that be something?!  If the sketches were released a year ago and the details that get hung up on, like the man she was texting or the phone being left down the street, had a reasonable and believable explanation and the P's themselves expressed a genuine desire for the people who caused SP harm to be brought to justice, it might actually make everything seem more plausible and could possibly turn skeptics around.  Instead, there seems to be more concern over stopping the handful of anonymous redditors who question the narrative as it is reluctantly presented by those who are supposedly 'in the know.'  Does it really matter so much what people on here think?  Or does it bother you because the things we are questioning out loud are the same questions you want to ask yourself?

I am a wife and a mom myself, and I don't personally want to cause Sherri or her family any harm in any way.  I have asked a lot of questions regarding this whole thing and I've joked around a bit, but I don't think I've ever intentionally said anything mean or offensive about her as a person.  I would just like to see some sense being made.  If Sherri or anyone else involved in this case would ever come on here, I would not be unkind or disrespectful to them.  I probably would have a lot of questions though.  ;)"|8||||0||1511071807.0|0|||False|0|8|I’d love to chat. If you’re interested pls private message me.I’m a mom of 3 too.

I deeply respect you for that. 

I have a difficult time with the negativity towards SP's appearance. I think it's mean and unnecessary beyond what is necessary to talk about with regards to the case. People talk about her smile and I think, so if someone had a cleft palate would people make fun of that? Probably not. People talk about her weight, her hair. Some people basically state she's a drug addict, specifically meth. That's not cool, at all. I think to myself, what if this were me, or anyone else on here, I know I would not want to be physically picked apart. 

Even if she is a narcissist, the reason people become narcissists is because of neglect and/or abuse and they have NO self esteem and build it up to protect themselves. If she has an eating disorder, they are generally developed in women (as teenagers) by sexual abuse. If she were a drug addict, she is self medicating/dulling the pain. Brushes with the law is another behavior that could signify some sort of abuse as a child. Having one of these things, I might not be so sure, but with all she presents, something happened to her as a child, imo. 

I empathize with SP as well. I am a mother of 2 boys, whom I love with all my heart and soul. I have no anger towards SP at all. She obviously needs help as she keeps finding herself in predicaments over and over and over again, creating her own chaos because for some reason (her childhood?), shes comfortable with chaos. But I also know you can't force someone to get (mental) help. Like an addict, they must hit their bottom before realizing their behaviors are affecting their family, relationships, work, etc.

I know all of the above is my opinion, just like everyone here has one. I guess it's when people's opinions are (subtley) cruel, that's when it bothers me. I also know my opinion is somewhat biased as... well I've written about my past and did a post in the very beginning why my opinion is what it is.

I would gladly talk to Sherri if she needed someone to talk to. I would share with her what I know about getting mental health services because it can be very confusing, especially when you're not 100%. I would share with her whatever experience I've had if she felt it would help her, or validate any of her feelings- of being unsatisfied with life, never feeling happy when you know you ""should"" because you've got it all- the house, the kids, a loving husband but you're still empty inside. 

Ps. I'll take this moment to apologize to anyone I've offended. I know I can get argumentative and it's not something I like about myself, but it comes from a place I don't know that you all would understand. My apology is sincere.

It is an error to interact with narcissists as though they were nornal people with normal motivations.  They are not.

To get through to them, you must crush their idealized image of themselves completely.  That is the only way they realize they have transgressed a boundary.  

To people who have never dealt with a narcissist, this appears rude and even cruel.  In fact, the narcissist will not respond positively to anything else, and will exploit mere politeness in destructive ways.

There are plenty of books out there on how to deal with them, which boils down to:

1. Stay away from them.
2. Enforce rigid boundaries.
3. Stomp on their idealized image whenever they cross a boundary.

I’ve had the misfortune to have encountered several in my life.  They are vortexes of destruction and the recipe above is the key to containing the damage.

When I look back, I was guided through this educational system we call the world and saved (using the Christian expression, although I don't know god as more than a gentle breeze blowing through this reality).

We don't know anything about her.  Because hearsay, news articles and personal experience is all we've got to try to connect the dots and make some sense out of the narrative we've been told.  I think it would go far if Sherri herself would step up to the plate and be her own voice.  By allowing everyone else to do the talking for her, she is being painted in an unflattering light.  By becoming her own advocate she likely will find some favor with the public.  By becoming concerned enough to be an advocate for others, she may actually be able to change people's perceptions of her completely and make a difference somewhere in the world.

It’s hard to explain and does make us seem ‘mean’ probably but the stories we could both tell I’m sure.

Then you realize the playbook the Sherri’s of the world use and that good people can’t even imagine being like this or relating in any way. 

Example - friend’s husband was known to community as wonderful church going great guy. Big family. Coached kids teams. Was ‘the guy’ to call when your car broke down. Charming. Great job and work ethic.

The real man? Child molester. Womanizer. When my friend got a knock at her door by the police for her husband, she sat and defended him. Not this guy. No way he was a molester! She got her parents to loan them money for an attorney.

Then something bizarre happened. She found a picture of another woman on his phone. 

She confronted him and asked about the woman and the dude flipped his shit on her. Stormed out.

He moved in with the other woman right then who he’d been seeing.  My friend begged him to come home even though she knew what she had suspected for years - that he was having affairs. 

He in turn told his new woman and family that my friend had set him up and was the reason kids were saying they were molested because she was jealous and he had asked for a divorce.

None of that was true but he was purposely playing all sides against the middle to cast doubt on the molestation charges that she finally came to see were true.

He tried to convince the police this was sour grapes from a obsessive wife who wouldn’t let him go - he had all the affairs to set up an exit plan should children come forward so he could blame her.

Unfortunately for him, a teen kept the clothes she was wearing and his semen was on it. She was a family friends daughter who he drove home after babysitting.

As for my friend, he was finally convicted but it took a long time and he got a sentence of 1 year. He got out but refuses to work to avoid child support.  He’s tried hard to convince the older kids their mom was behind it all and he’s innocent. His family sticks by him.

The kids know he’s a creep and refuse contact. Friend is on welfare and does childcare when she can.  His affair woman dumped him after about a year and he lives with his parents.  They all claim my friend set him up to this day.

This is how narcissists work - Keith probably knows sherri will destroy him if he tells the truth (or she may have some elaborate cover story blaming someone else)

EDIT: to add that when my friend asked why he had affairs, he said she didn’t give him enough sex so it’s her fault."|9||||0||1511056420.0|0|||False|0|9|How can we convince that cat to come down out of her tree?|40|

Narcissists use their superficial charm to create chaos by triggering drama between isolated groups of their “friends”.  They set them against one another, convincing each that they’re the only person telling them the truth.  This feeds their narcissistic need for admiration.  When the well starts to run dry, they use the emptied friend to move onto another.

I worked with as evil and complete a narcissist as I have ever seen.  Worse, my boss (and hers) was one himself.  She assumed the role of his secret police, feeding his paranoia while basking in the glow of his need.  This was an F5 shitstorm and it will likely end up bankrupting a Fortune 500 company next year.  She eventually got promoted thanks to his nonstop demand she be, she managed to get all of her enemies” (moi aussi) projects cancelled and most of us laid off or demoted (“releveled”).  When her boss became useless to her she got him exiled.  Now she’s isolated and is undermining his boss.  All this despite the fact she literally has not done a lick of work in the past four years.

I told him to leave  and called he cops. When LE failed to believe me (because DV and bank robbery are easily confused), he used 8 CPS visits, 35 check the welfares, 8 calls to my HR Dept, 187 social media posts about me in derogatory context, calling all my friends and family, using the court system to file bogus restraining orders I had to have quashed all the time.... and the list goes on.  People didn’t believe me at first.  They thought I was crazy.  Not even LE.  It was awful. I had to NOT defend myself and go radio silent.  Any attention reinforces and creates narcissist supply.  

Karma caught up and he’s doing 10 years for unrelated crimes.  LE has possibly mentioned in passing they know of 3 banks he’s hit but can’t prove it.  The chief of Police and I are very close now. 

The only way to deal with narcissists is to not engage. Keep impeccable boundaries. Avoid being predictable because they are the ultimate button pushers but then act innocent.  "|3||||0||False|0|||False|0|3|How can we convince that cat to come down out of her tree?|40|

This whole escapade had the ingredients which caught my obsessive personality's attention.   Also, unfairly I'm sure, SP reminds me of a woman I knew back in my army says - she was a real operator and man manipulator.  I always say that the trick for obsessives like myself is to try to focus my obsession on good things or things which make money.  This doesn't qualify but I got stuck in the mud regardless.  

UPS brought the ski rack for my new car this afternoon and I naturally couldn't wait to install it and it had to be perfect so my obsession caused me to miss dinner.  But that ski rack looks great on the car.  Opening day tomorrow!

I think the draw here for me was that this story just didn't add up and seemed very false from the very beginning.  We might go to war with North Korea but I don't care, I just want to know what really happened here.

I hope SP gets tired of withholding the truth and sees the wisdom of honesty and full disclosure before it's too late.  Living with a societal lie of this magnitude is ultimately life threatening and is certainly life inhibiting.  I think she already realizes this but is afraid to live through the controversy which will follow full disclosure.  You have to be brave and walk through the fire and deal with the consequences positively if you want long term happiness and success.

But you fail to see that there are so many inconsistencies, contradictions, and implausible factors here, that the public IS being objective and it is the P's and LE being a bit un-objective.... literally living in a fantasy world and expecting everyone to buy the ridiculous stuff their are selling.

Never once has anyone of the many different ""spokespersons"" ever said ""the facts are undeniable and here they are""...""

Instead they make puzzling statements like Bosenko saying it appeared the phone & earbuds were neatly placed, or ""no reason not to believe"", beaten & starved nearly to death yet treated and quickly released from the ER, or most recently the discrepancies between one vs two people pushing her out of the SUV and the ankles vs. wrists bound & ""chained to something"" yet she's sprinting freely., and the many times they have cited things that don't add up - 

Heck - look at this statement just days ago by Sgt. Jackson:

**""none of the received tips have been able to generate a viable lead or**

**information as to who is responsible for Sherri’s abduction,” said Jackson.**

Note he DOES NOT SAY ""kidnappers"" and he clearly suggests, there is no evidence to support SP's version of events.  AND he highlights how absolutely pi** poor SP's eyewitness account is and how she has done so little to help her own case by giving such limited eyewitness testimony to cops.  Then where's the outrage by SP & family to catch the kidnappers?  Yet, here YOU ARE attacking the good people of the concerned public who DO want to get to the bottom of this.  

I'd say you and the P's are solely responsible for what you decry as ""PERSECUTION AND HARASSMENT"" and you exaggerate the impact of the public's legitimate response to the story and place that as a greater concern than finding the alleged kidnappers.

.

One more thing...what will happen if they ever do catch the two Hispanic women (if they exist) and put them on trial?

**Surely you know they will get an attorney and that attorney will call Sherri to the witness stand and staunchly challenge every piece of her story and tear her credibility to shreds.  His questioning of SP will make her realize that a few doubts the public had were NOTHING compared to what the lawyers will grill her on and make her look like a liar and a fool.

This may be true after all of these long month's of very little information from LE or the Ps, we tend to keep this sub alive by entertaining ourselves a bit by some off the wall theories and subjects.  I'm sure it drives you and the Ps crazy that the non-believers are still alive and hitting the google search results daily when they were hoping this whole thing would go away by now.

Jackson said that the family was free to talk with the media but that didn't happen, except for a short thanks to supporters from KP.  SP could easily do an interview and explain her whole 22 days from when the banditas rolled up in their hats and sunglasses until Maria got up at 4AM to drop her beside the highway so she could by home for Thanksgiving like KP promised the kids.

Yep, I remember when you said there was no Michigan Man period.  Jackson said that there not only was a MM but she had been texting him for months and had planned to meet up with him when he was in California.

I value compassion.  Help me understand how I can decrease the media’s  “persecution and harassment” you reference?  Reddit is not a media source.  I try to live by doing no harm to others, so am open to your feedback.  

You do bring up a great quote by the Sheriff in Shasta County that many of us have addressed.  I perceive the Sheriff’s statements different from you.  Please note he never stated he had reason to believe her story.  No, he said he had no reason to NOT believe her story.  Those two things are not synonymous.  That’s powerful.  

You bring up great points that equally annoy me with online discussion boards.  Sometimes people make assumptions based on misinformation and half truths. 

The court of public opinion does not respond well to silence. They often confuse it for guilt.  Maybe the family should attempt to control their narrative a little better and release LE approved information, if public image truly bothers them.  

I do extensive work with local LE agencies during accusations of excessive use of force.  There was a time when police remained quiet while an internal investigation ensued against an officer(s)— but then media saturated coverage, most commonly using bystander cell phone video of only the climax (missing the entire antecedent event) presenting a distorted view of the incident.  Couple that with the court of public opinion not understanding LE’s authorized use of force or what the law actually dictates.  LE now gets in front of allowing others to tell their narrative.  

Happy Thanksgiving to all on that note!"|2||||0||1511457149.0|0|||False|0|2|Sherri Papini - You Have Wasted My Time!!|53|

We know that the good people of Shasta County donated $50k to ""Bring Sherri home"".  They spent about $15k of that on PIs ostensibly to help find her but then decided to spend the other $35k for other purposes.  They could have added the remainder to the reward for arrest of her abductors, but that didn't seem to be a priority and they obviously felt that the money was theirs to use as they wished.  We don't know that she went missing for a GFM scam or to perhaps extort money from a rich member of her family but it's a possibility.

I don't believe her story, but I don't necessarily believe it was a pre-planned hoax either.  I definitely think she knew the people she left with and the ones she stayed with and the one who got up early to drop her off by the highway so she could be home by Thanksgiving.

I'm not here to make things worse.

Yes it looks bad to a lot of people and it looks bad that the anger from the Ps is directed at us versus whomever perpetrated this fiasco but there are innocent children involved.

SP- your husband seems to really love you. Despite the criticism he receives here because of his odd ball communication and his anger towards doubter versus the ""bad people"" 

I would say you didn't hurt anyone but yourself but you took money under false pretenses (or someone in your behalf did) and you left your children and then remained silent instead of offering any explanation so you can't blame people for calling ""bullshit"" however, if you make things right with your family and get the courage to come clean and get help it's worth it because the most important people to be good for is your children. You don't have to be perfect, let that shit go, you can be better than perfect by being REAL.  

A lot of us have troubles at home from time to time and internally as well. Don't do anything else drastic. Take it easy. Focus on your family. Make an honest statement for once. Let go of the anger- makes things worse.

Some do take place on public lands (State Parks and such) and that can be risky for someone unknowingly walking by or through a ""farm"".

Part of me thinks KP would have immediately jumped all over CG's reverse ransom idea out of desperation to try anything to get is wife back, but another part of me thinks that he probably hesitated to consider it because maybe he was advised not to step on LE's toes with the investigation or maybe he hesitated cause CG's idea just sounded crazy- if they really believed she was taken something like what he proposed could have cost her life if it didn't go according to their plan.|3||||0||1510957834.0|0|||False|0|3|Basic timeline recap|31|

I hate that mental illness is so heavily stigmatized. I do think that in some cases it's dangerous to brush certain symptoms or diagnoses off as harmless (Read: PPP and Andrea Yates) but that doesn't make someone less deserving of help.

Who says ""We need 50k, to get her home safe"", unless you know for sure that she IS alive and CAN come home?

Some anonapapinii say that SP left the hair and phone as a coded message to KP that she had been abducted and not disappeared volutarily. Makes no sense. If SP wanted to send a message to KP, she would have held on to her phone for as long as possible, knowing he uses the findmyphone app. 

Other anonapapinii say that SP lost the hair and phone in a struggle with the latina banditas. Makes no sense. It wouldn't have been placed neatly, if she lost it in a struggle. 

My personal theory: SP left the phone as a FU to KP, because she wanted some alone time with her boyfriend/drugdealer.

I guess that's right as I spent much of my career as a systems analyst.  I believe in identifying the true root cause of problems per Deming principles.  I'm a good mechanic although I've never worked at it professionally.  People bring me all kinds of stuff to fix and I can usually troubleshoot it quite fast.

I'm also an obsessive.  I never let go of stuff that I gain an interest in.  I think that's why the P case drives me crazy.  We sense there is a problem with the narrative as presented but we don't have enough information to determine the true root cause.  I'm the doubting Thomas.

Sherri and Keith may or may not divorce, but with the current circumstances, I'd imagine it would be hard to maintain the same Barbie and Ken marriage they (supposedly) had before.

I feel so bad for the Papini kids. One thing that I appreciate about our community is that everyone is always normal and reasonable about their kids.  No one is mean. I've seen some article comment sections where people spread rumors involving them, and just say some straight up mean stuff. That's just so wrong to me. Those kids can't control who their parents are. 

I hope that they remember - they aren't their parents. Sherri and Keith's choices/behavior have nothing to do with who the kids are.

Regardless of what happened to Sherri (an abduction, hoax, somewhere in between), I hope that she gets some therapy. Her kids need a good mom. She doesn't need to be a *supermom* - just a normal, nice, emotionally stable mom.

I think she miscalculated how badly her effort would appear - but then, sociopathic people and liars tend to conclude everyone will buy the crap they're selling.

I am not even so sure the cops think there was a REAL CRIME.

If there were a REAL kidnapping - wouldn't we see a WHOLE LOT more evidence of an aggressive attempt at investigation?  People rounded up for questioning, releases of photos, sketches, video right away?  Vigorous public pleas for those with info to come forward and help?  Wouldn't the cops give frequent if not daily briefings like they did with the JonBenet Ramsey and Atlanta murders cases?

Instead - their actions and words convince me they know this is all bullcrap.  The hints that the phone and earbuds were carefully placed & staged, and statements that nobody's been ruled out, and double negatives like ""we have no reason not to believe"" and the way they hid & stonewalled the public info on the old police reports - and silly statements like **""I think the public should be vigilant, but I don’t believe there is a public safety concern""** when people are worried there's kidnappers loose in their town.
Then there's the ridiculous contradictions like Keith saying the hose clamps were on her wrists and the two of them pushed her out of the car - when the Sheriff says the hose clamps were on her ankles (but didn't impair sprinting at top speed) and only one was present pushing her out.

WAY too much funny stuff to take anything seriously - **this is about as solid as Balloon Boy story or Tawana Brawley.**"|10||||0||False|0|||False|0|10|Beauty and the Brains|50|

I was told they are sticking together for the ‘book/movie deal.’ 

I think Sherri is pretending there’s a book movie deal and that’s why she can’t give exclusive information. More of her lies.

The kids are beautiful and precious. Neighbors mentioned seeing Keith hands on with them most of the time - I think he’s more involved with them than she’s ever been. 

Someone mentioned RR3 stating they watched the kids on weekends. He did post that under Redding Crime 2.0 and detailed their daycare situation so that Sherri could plan out their homeschooling and do errands without them.

As for Sherri’s motive, I think she got fed up with Keith and left with another man and went on a bender. 

He gave her a way to come back with his insistence (pleading) that she was ‘kidnapped.’ 

I actually believe the police have surveillance of her either being dropped off or taken or in between but have bungled the case. Or been pressured to drop it.

So did she leave her dogs and baby chicks home alone for days? Because as someone who has pet hens who act like cats and are my spoiled babies it sickens me to think they left their babies alone for days. They need new water and food daily so if she did then I truly hope she just rots in jail.

That's sad anyone would say anything about the kids. They are adorable. I feel for them. I hope they have good influences and lots of people who care about them.

I did feel bad in the feeding cat picture the boy and SP were all bundled up the girl had thin clothes and no shoes on.  Every other time the kids looked well dressed and happy. I know looks can be deceiving but I took comfort in that. I always dressed and continue with my youngest to the same level of warmth/or breathability (in summer) as myself. In winter at least as warm if not more so especially for a baby.  If I wear a warm coat and hat my children have the a warm jacket and hat, and gloves, and scarf.

It's probably not that big of a deal but they seemed to take the time to bundle the boy and the girl looked like an after thought who looked unclothed compared to everyone else.

I guess I was just surprised HOW much time they spend with them.  In a way they're lucky to have a set of grandparents there so willing; but in a way I wondered if Sherri was a bit irritated that RRIII and Keith's mom were the hosts to so many events.  SP & KP were most likely living rent-free in the parents' home, and paying for the annual vacation, and babysitting for free so maybe she went along with it.

Ok, he didn't believe the abduction nonsense, and called her out on selling sim cards on the side, but I thought it was refreshing to hear about SP from a time when she appeared to be happy.

Makes me think that SP did disappear, because she was bored being a SAHM at the end of a sketchy road. If she is bubbly and outgoing, she would thrive better being around people all day, not stuck at home with two kids waiting for KP to come home."|18||||0||False|0|||False|0|18|Oh how interesting, g|24|

""When you're drunk, you're never bored. Did you know that? You may bore other people. But the moments slip by in such a satisfactory manner.""

I think she went from socially active breadwinner to dull nothingness, so she found ways of occupying her time. Not necessarily drinking specifically, but drugs, men, etc. I also think she went about constructing a fake image of herself to others, so she probably did engage in petty theft from her ex-employer, but that's something that would damage her false Saint Sherri image."|11||||0||False|0|||False|0|11|Oh how interesting, g|24|

Definitely a hoax. Just a thought though, if it does turn out to be a hoax they could likely still face a charge of filing a false report since the statue of limitations begins ticking from the moment of discovery. If Boss Hog comes to the conclusion later that this was a hoax, he has from that point on to act on the information/build a case against them for that. It isn't necessarily from when KP first reported her missing. A friend of mine was abused by her step father during her childhood. And they managed to build a case against him after she came forward about it as an adult.

530 said that she was on maternity leave through the end and that her job ended because of downsizing he thought.  I would say that she had compensation throughout most of 2016 from her maternity leave and unemployment compensation but that likely ended in September or October.

About a week ago I saw that I was tagged on Reddit. I only created this account because I was hooked on this case, but left when I was accused of trolling. 

As of now, I would say that half of Redding believes this story. 

My Theory: I believe this happened because Sherri was cheating. Keith was upset that she left her phone (it was a giant F You) and then he created this mess to get back at her. This is how he knew she would be coming home on Thanksgiving Day. I think they are both crazy and it was almost like some ultamitum (“If you don’t come back by X then I’ll expose you” type of deal). It turned into this giant mess and they had to play the part.

He had an extensive post history that supported many of his claims regarding his career and location. We cannot attest to the veracity of his statements or even if he knew Sherri for sure. He is purporting to be Sherri's client, so that is why we are referring to him as such. The mods haven't received verification for that part of it and haven't claimed that we have. All considering, I personally think it's pretty unlikely that he's lying. 

We always ask if we can share the verification with the readership - the guest can either say yes or no. Fivethreezero declined - we will always respect a participant's wishes in that regard.

We are volunteer moderators on Reddit, nothing more. Our only responsibility (with AMAs) is to coordinate a time and place for a user to answer questions. We do make a reasonable attempt to investigate the legitimacy of that user and their claims - but it's really up to you. We can only do so much. We encourage skepticism, even directed towards users that provide verification.

People are free to take or leave whatever they want away from the AMA, just like any other opinion or perspective offered on the sub.

She actually seemed to sound very relatable, from what he said.  She was committed to her job, did it well, spoke lovingly about her kids, was very friendly and well liked and it sounded like he and other people had an overall positive view of her.  The only thing he said that was negative, that I can recall, was regarding the incident where she made a demeaning remark about his customer which, if what he said was true, may have been a peek into her personality behind the professional image she upheld on the job.  

I think it's a good practice to take everything that people say with a grain of salt.  I don't see any reason why this person would have made anything up but who knows.  Everything he expressed was from his own perspective and other than it being interesting to hear, I don't count any of it as fact.  Unless it is information that comes from LE and is confirmed as facts with evidence to back it up, it's not something I form my own opinions about this case on.  But I think it is to be appreciated that he came on here and answered all the questions in a, seemingly, unbiased way.

I do appreciate the efforts of the mods who put in the time and work to hold these AMA's, as well as all their hard work monitoring this sub.  I think they are doing a great job and I think they are awesome at handling all the obstacles that arise.  "|13||||0||False|0|||False|0|13|Post AMA Discussion - Sherri Papini's Client|177|

>The area code for the largest marijuana producing region in California. Used to denote very high quality and potent marijuana.

>""I was hunting for some 420 but the 530 showed up!""

And then the there is the Angel Number 530.  Wasn't SP AngelFlyHigh or something?

>Significance & Meaning Of Angel Number 530.

>530 is a number that you have been researching about. It showed up on your birthday. It also showed up in your telephone number. The guardian angels would like to guide you through your journey of life.

>Thanksgiving is a virtue mentioned by angel number 530. This is being grateful for all the things that one has acquired over the years. You have been blessed with a lot of fine things. You feel that your efforts have paid off.

I used to live there so I have a lot of friends on social media still there. Recently share of a mutual friend who's early 20s pretty blonde with daughter posted picture of the people magazine. Their commentary along the lines was we all know it's bogus let's move on. 

I suspect the only sympathizers/believers at this point come from a handful of areas: are the Bethel types (I agree with the AMA comments they made re: Bethel), the racist types who believe Latinos are all to be feared and love this story fueling that, and the lemmings to their leader type - the ones who practically vote against themselves in politics but don't care as long as they're wearing the same political team colors. There will also be the ones who know her sister or parents etc who feel too close and compassionate (cannot blame them) to doubt, given their pain and concern may have been very real, so out of respect they aren't openly skeptical.

In some ways I wasn't openly skeptical either just because I didn't want to risk putting my foot in my mouth if she was in fact a victim. "|1||||0||False|0|||False|0|1|Post AMA Discussion - Sherri Papini's Client|177|

I thought it was a great AMA because whether or not we believed 530, it forced us to a place where we had to consider that maybe Sherri is more than just the victim/non victim in all this. Maybe she got dressed up and went to work every day and had interactions with guys who thought she was pretty and nice and she was making decent money, while married to a guy with a wealthy sorta step-parent. Maybe she thought she was all set up for a nice ride through life. Next thing you know she's a stay at home mom, money is tight, hubby isn't much of an earner, pseudo step dad goes Chapter 11. No guys around chatting her up, kids are at daycare, she's a bored Mom sitting home selling used clothing and bags online. She maybe has a random hookup that goes wrong, hubby brings in the infantry. She's global news. Who wants to admit you were screwing around and the guy/guys girl went crazy on you? Catch 22. |4||||0||1510847659.0|0|||False|0|4|Post AMA Discussion - Sherri Papini's Client|177|

Side note, I've got back pain that I deal with on a constant basis and a co-worker once made a really nice compliment about how I looked and I was genuinely thankful because I'm always in some level of pain and always assumed people could tell just by observing the way I do things or by facial expressions, etc. This person had no idea and said I hide it very well, and I seriously am floored by this because I assume it's written all across my forehead.

I don't doubt Sherri is a likable person, especially at work.  When she went missing a lot of people spoke about what a wonderful person she is, and I believe they think that for the most part.  Although I must say looking at some of their faceboks, it almost looks like they are putting on an act if that makes sense, to appear loving and deeply concerned, yet taking fun selfies a couple posts later.  



Anyway, my guess is that SP is, and has always been a brat.  I think she was probably a cute girl who assumed her looks would carve her out a nice easy path in life.  She thinks she deserves more, like a nice new house in a nice subdivision with a nice husband with a big boat.  Instead she's living along a gravel road in weird parts of Redding, CA with 2 kinds and a husband that installs surround sound for people in those nice subdivisions.  I think she held it together in some capacity for a long time, at least in front of strangers, co-workers, etc. Then her narcissistic behaviors just snowballed until she reached the grand Latina finale.

But if she was just someone you saw for a couple hours here and there, I'm sure she could easily put on a nice face. My in-law would do almost anything for a stranger or someone that would make her look like she's a kind, loving person.  She would help with fund raisers and bake sales etc. but if I were to ask for something it would be met with this big thing about how disruptive it is to her time, etc.  Meanwhile I've bailed them out financially multiple times because I care about her husband and their kids, and never so much a 'thank you' from her (not that I need a thank you). And she's constantly mad at her husband that they don't have a nicer house in a nicer area, etc.   But again, if you asked the moms from school they would tell you this woman is a saint.




So I guess my point is, some people don't sniff out BS well at all, and some narcissistic people are very good at putting on a nice person front.  I also think the older they get the more the facade starts to crack, and Sherri's still relatively young.  I'm sure some people who new Sherri in a different capacity would have a slightly different view of her."|7||||0||False|0|||False|0|7|Post AMA Discussion - Sherri Papini's Client|177|

FWIW I don't know that people are bad judges of character (though many are) as much as it is that people actually pay very little attention to anyone but themselves. Even selfless people aren't paying attention to people's behavior in a critical manner. On top of that our memories are not great and very naturally prone to filling in the blanks from repetition rather than actual kmowledge.

So ""she was normal and didn't seem trashed the few times I directly interacted with her when I was more concerned about my car being at the mechanic's and resolving a customer complaint"" becomes, ""yes, she was friendly and seemed sober"".

This isn't to disparage 530, it's just the reality of human observational skills and memory.

Sherri is all up in her feelings. 

Girlfriend, it's only a matter of time before others talk about you. Maybe your own husband. Eventually your kids will talk. They don't stay babies for ever and eventually they will read all about you or they will have to endure more trauma if Keith can't put up with your bullshit anymore and a custody battle ensues. If it comes out you hurt yourself you will be considered a danger to the children. Get aggressive treatment. Admit. Apologize. Get right for your children.  No matter what you are dealing with it will only get worse if continue to blame others and never take ownership.

Their kids get to go to a better school.  They have nicer cars and vacations, etc.

Look at all those mommy bloggers out there who perpetuate the supermom myth (cough-JenGam-cough).  SP seems like the type who is susceptible to buying into that nonsense. Just look at her wedding blog, she was headed down that path. 

She's pretty, she had a good job (how the hell did she get that with no education?), cute kids, attractive(ish) husband, etc. 

In the last few years maybe some of those things are starting to fade. She got a few wrinkles or a stretch mark. Lost her job so less money for fun stuff and less adult interaction. The kids are still cute, but becoming more independent and less manageable (toddlers, amiright?). KP is tired all the time and starts to let down the perfect facade. Maybe he starts farting and belching in front of her, THE HORROR!

**We have all been there.** And it sucks. Finding out that life isn't a fairy tale for anyone is a hard lesson to learn.  If you buy into those staged mommy blogs then you might think it's only you who isn't living a perfect life.

But, there's nothing above that can't be fixed. Even if she was cheating on KP, it can be fixed. People get through that all the time. Even a fake kidnapping can be fixed, if that is indeed what really happened.  Hiding out and ignoring things is the opposite of fixing things.

I know there is a genetic component to mental illness and that ""they"" also tell us that if you were traumatized, abused and neglected and if your parents were batshit you are likely to turn out to have a miserable life etc.  

Well, that doesn't have to be true. These books talked about how a lot of ""us"" turn out to be great and they provide data and stuff. 

I know SP kids are young but I hope they always remember that everything that you decide what kind of person you are and you can be a better person, a better parent etc than what you had

Same goes for anyone who was sexually or physically abused/exploited as a child. Cycle stops with us. Everything that happens bad you can never let that make YOU bad. And for people that use that as an excuse for when they do bad, that's offensive to survivors who would rather die than do what was done to them to others.

Sorry. Trying to figure this out. 

Anyway   Just few more comments. I work in law enforcement but not a cop. The police must def know who did this and a fake. Otherwise would have warned public a little more. Also I deal with a lot of people suffering with personality disorders and they have no issues harming themselves. Tons of scars. But I don't think this has anything to do with her mental health.

Note 2: I do not believe Bethel had any direct affiliations in all of this but i just want to go on my little bethel rant

Redding is an interesting little city. Very conservative and also poor while still being in California. Redding is not very diverse as well. When i went to high school there was probably less than 10 black kids in the whole school with a enrollment size of 1400. Redding has many religious people. somewhere out there is some statistic about the highest amount of churches per capita idk if its true or not but its definitely believable.

Bethel people are just weird. I think they believe in like this faith healing stuff like where your in a wheelchair all your life then pray then you can magically walk. Like at work ive had multiple occations where Bethel people will stop me and ask if they could pray for me. Anything to do with bethel just creeps me out because they have so much money and I (and many of the older locals) are scared that they will start to influence city leaders and promote Bethel things (idklol). When you have city counsel leaders in bethel you have to always wonder who are they really going up to bat for. Its nerve racking. Oh yeah and im pretty sure the redding convention center which was like a place where there would be concerts  or other cool events is now owned by bethel. kinda strange


Bottom line is Bethel is strange and anything they are involved in I always am cautious about.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/husband-super-mom-describes-moment-alleged-kidnappers-released/story?id=43884808

But later there were other reports that only one of the kidnappers was in the SUV when Sherri was released.

So Which is it?

All the details about the severity of injuries, broken nose, massive weight loss (""emaciated"") came from the same person who said both were in the SUV when they shoved her out - so who to believe?

The report that Sherri ""wasn't seen on any of the church videos"" came from a representative of the church who had familiarity with the videos.  Maybe what he meant was that she couldn't be identified with certainty but definitely someone was seen.  The church also has multiple other video angles which might have seen Sherri or something further that would be helpful, BUT those tapes have not been released.

There were reports that Keith took a picture of Sherri's phone before picking it up (then those reports were verified when the 911 call was released and Keith does indeed say he took a picture) and thus he disturbed the evidence.  Nobody has ever shown that picture, why??  How could that violate the integrity of he investigation?

The Sheriff did say none of the SUV's or vehicles caught on video cameras in the area were identified by Sherri.  But how many were seen and how extensive was the video surveillance coverage. If it is extensive then it brings into question how could a big SUV be missed?

.

Here's a little logical deduction...
If an SUV was on Old Oregon Trail and wanted to get anywhere they'd virtually HAVE TO head to I-5 and the I-5 interchange that's a little over a mile away,

There's a gas station there and every gas station has video surveillance - most with multiple cameras pointing everywhere- especially out toward the street and viewing which way traffic goes - to identify & catch drive-offs and crooks.  Surely if there was a BIG DARK SUV in broad daylight, they would HAVE to sooner or later go right past this gas station (maybe more than once, to get to where they nabbed her and then again to go back & get on I-5 & head to Yolo).  Google maps has crystal clear pics of that gas station and you can see the video cameras!

Will the Sheriff ever address the ABSENCE of any such car on those videos and any others in the entire area??  "|11||||0||1510782313.0|0|||False|0|11|Details We (I) Have Been Taking For Granted ...but that did not officially come from SCSO/LE|39|

Hi all. Long time member but I thought thought this was a good time to pop in in my ""professional"" capacity, such as it is.  The mods have verified I'm a real life nurse (and no, SP, I won't send you my resume or home address) so maybe I can be of a bit of assistance occasionally.

I know she was bruised but do nurses notice or note those type of things ? 

YES. Sorry to tell you all this, but nurses definitely notice your hairy legs and/or armpits etc.  If she showed up with smooth legs, those nurses were definitely side-eyeing her.  I suppose she could claim the kidnappers let her shave with her shower, but that would just add to them being the worst kidnappers ever.

 Nurses would notice bruising also. If they did a good job of documentation, then it would mention the color, size and location of the bruises as well. If Keith is to be believed about old and new bruising, then she should have many different shades.  The notes would say something like: ""large green and yellow ecchymosis noted to left jaw.  Round, red ecchymosis on posterior lower leg.  Purple ecchymosis surrounding right eye."" They have to be pretty specific. Since it was a crime they probably would have taken pictures with measuring tape on the wounds to fully document everything.  The police would have been in on that part most likely.  

I should add that I've never worked in an ER, but I have worked at the next step past ER (ICU). I've taken care of a lot of crime victims and the things I haven't seen first hand I have heard about from friends in ER or seen in the patient's chart.  I will be vigilant to not report anything as fact unless I have personally been part of it.  

I can't say for sure about the starving part, as I've never dealt with someone in that condition.  I think it would just depend on what her labs show and her clinical presentation.  For example, if her electrolytes were low, she would need to stay to have them replaced because that's dangerous.  The same for blood sugar, kidney function and probably a million other labs I can't think of at the moment. Or if she had really low blood pressure, she'd need to stay until it was normalized. That might only take a few bags of fluid via IV though.  She would probably be acting abnormally if some of those were off as well.  That would buy her some more time in the hospital by itself.  No doctor is going to send her home if she's acting goofy.  That's just asking for a lawsuit. 

Bottom line: If she was in the shape that Keith says, I cannot see how she was treated and released in the same day.  "|7||Consultant - Registered Nurse||0||False|0|||False|0|7|Details We (I) Have Been Taking For Granted ...but that did not officially come from SCSO/LE|39|

(I have medical and ER experience)

it would be a matter of degree--- if someone were mildly dehydrated or nutritionally deficient then at age 34, they'd probably get a liter or two of IV fluids and be OK to go home..

BUT - severe starvation and dehydration would almost certainly also be accompanied by severe imbalance of ""electrolytes"" (the minerals such as sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, etc.) and possibly even protein deficiency (as seen more commonly in some places in Africa - 

http://www.nutritionmd.org/health_care_providers/general_nutrition/protein_malnutrition.html

....and that would take many hours and even days to correct using intravenous solutions and oral supplements.

The question about lab tests- almost everything such as blood counts, electrolyte and protein measures, liver tests, kidney functional tests and even the preliminary infection tests (UA, gram stains) can be completed in minutes to an hour or two.
The analysis for presence of toxins and drugs may take several hours and if needed to sent off-site, maybe a couple days.

I have never worked in one so small, so I'm just guessing.  I would guess not long, though. A few hours at the most.  Labs can even be ordered as STAT which means they go to the front of the line and get run before any routine ones. I'm guessing there probably weren't a lot in front of hers in such a small hospital and on Thanksgiving morning. 

One caveat to that is toxicology.  Those results apparently sometimes take longer.  I'm basing that on what we hear about cases in the media, not personal experience.  By that I mean this: police are always saying toxicology results will be available in a few days, etc.  I have never understood that, as in my experience the basic ones are pretty fast. We always knew a patients blood alcohol, benzo, narco, etc levels before we got them from ER. 

It's also possible that a smaller facility would not be able to run all the labs that I'm used to at a big place and some would have to be sent out. Those would take longer obviously. But I would think the one Sherri went to would be able to run all of the ones that would have been necessary.

In my western state (not CA), the law states that one cannot KNOWINGLY make a false police and specifies this includes a kidnapping report.  Looking at KP: what did he know and when did he know it? If he currently has a reasonable belief the kidnapping did NOT occur, I would think he has an ONGOING duty to correct his report. However, I do not see him charged if he made a good-faith report initially.  And perhaps he did.  

As for SP- it is hazier:  is she feigning no memory because  LE warned her that she could be charged with perjury?  She did not initiate the original kidnapping report.  Did she act in a reckless manner on November 2, 2016 such that she knew others impacted would be concerned enough to report? Possibly.  But, did she think they would call her in as simply missing or KIDNAPPED?  

Agree that the family cannot really say, “Oops- not a kidnapping after all, my bad.”  No dialing it back now. The prosecutor  makes the charging decisions based in large part on LE recommendations. If SP is sympathetic enough, and IF she was so mentally ill /overwhelmed/under stress at the time of the incident; & her atty makes it clear SHE  did not foresee KP calling in the calvary, and is now receiving help,  I could see the prosecutor passing in charging this out. It was a “family incident” gone really, really bad  in an unforeseeable way.

There has been precedent with other “lost” or “kidnapped” people being held accountable for costs and criminally charged- but I believe those defendants personally MADE the reports. In So Cal, I recall some hikers -on -meth being charged for rescue costs and when their “lost in the woods” story did not add up.  

This may explain the lack of LE action to date. I wonder if the Papinii are furious at KP for making it a 3-alarm fire immediately... like, “thanks, douche.”

I do NOT think we know that  SP affirmatively reported a crime herself- it could be a lot of hemming and hawing, “uh, uh, I just don’t remember, I THINK  there was a bag on my head made of paper-maybe? Um,It is all hazy from the trauma.”    She was initially responding to LE’s follow-up on  Doofus’s report.  Not calling it in herself. 

I agree that at some point she adopted the kidnap story as her own, and ran with it.  Things changed when LE had her commit to facts. Hence, the  latina kidnappers. Possibly  a  knowing false report & thus a crime. Reporting that she was left on the side of the road.  False ? There is tons of reasonable doubt here for a jury.  Is her memory impacted by trauma?  Was it real?  Did she hallucinate and she legitimately relies on her false memory?  Ugh.

Off -topic, but this woman (linked article) COPPED to her fake story immediately.  It generated sympathy. She also blamed perpetrators of  a different race.  It has been said here before: Had SP been wise enough to cough up the truth-this outcome could have been the end of her  story.  On the other hand, SP “trauma/ amnesia” machinations are an awesome defense.   I  bet Thurston Howell 3/RR3 had SP  advised and prepped by a defense atty immediately.

SP: ""I just walked down to get the mail and these 2 Mexican ladies, wearing hats and sunglasses, rolled up on me in a dark SUV and stuck a gun out the window and, in Spanglish, told me to lose the phone and earbuds and get in the vehicle.  I didn't want to just throw my phone on the ground so I removed my earbuds, wound them carefully, and placed it on the ground behind the mailboxes before getting in the car.  I knew Keith would find them and know immediately that some people had grabbed me.""

Cops:  ""We can see by the JW video that you can really run fast even after being starved, beaten, and tortured for 3 weeks.   Why didn't you just run when their car was on the drive and you were behind the mailboxes?"".

SP: ""Ever since I had a fight with one and bashed her head into the bleachers and then the next day they came and kicked the shit out of me and broke my leg, Mexican women scare the hell out of me and their gun was so big.  I was paralyzed I tell you.""

Cops: ""Why can't you provide a better description of these women since they didn't have masks on when they rolled up?""

SP: ""I was just so traumatized that I completely blanked out.  They all look alike to us white folks anyway, you know"".

Cops:  ""Then what happened?"".

SP:  ""I got in the back seat and the older one with the gun put a bag over my head and tied me to something.  Then they drove away"".

Cops:  ""How long did they drive?""

SP: ""I can't remember, all I could think about was that I couldn't pick up the kids and I couldn't call because I didn't have my phone.""

Cops: ""Could you tell by the speed and movement of the car if they entered the freeway?""

SP: ""Again, so worried about not picking up the kids that I can't remember a thing.""

Cops: ""At some point they got you out of the car and took you into a house, shipping container, basement or some building, is that correct?"".

SP:  ""I don't know what it was but it was just awful I tell you.""

Cops: ""At this point did the Mexican ladies have on their bandanas and why do you think that they felt they needed them considering you had already seen their faces.""

SP:  [Intense sobbing] ""Can you please pass the Kleenex box?""  [Intense sobbing] ""It's that darn PTSD making me cry again.  It was so awful, just awful I tell you.""  [intense sobbing].

KP:  ""[Intense sobbing] I'm sorry but that's all she can do today.  [Intense Sobbing] She's so brave you understand. [Intense sobbing]  ""And she used to make the best pies in Shasta county until all this happened, I tell you.  Now she can't even remember how to make a pie - those damn Mexican ladies.

Personally I’ve never been around drug use in my life so it’s interesting to read about the “functional” addicts.

I think it's illegal everywhere to take work as a PI if you aren't licensed but if you're just giving an opinion I don't see why that would matter. Might be illegal to hold yourself out as a PI without an actual license.

The funniest thing though is that a PI would never do an anonymous AMA anyways. You guys had one on once and she gave her identification. Why? Because it's good for business.

Since we don’t know what the brand looks like it could be minimal. People get the idea that it a cattle brand and think “ who would do that” 
Id bet money it was a lighter and something like a chain 

People get tattoos which hurt like hell, people have babies that hurt like hell, she has had elective surgery , possibly eggs retrieved. So it’s not like a brand on her body is going to hurt much more , plus 
She has reports of self harming in the past. 

If I was going to sell this kidnapping story I would probably suck it up. Also people who are high as hell on drugs don’t feel pain like you would if you were sober.

To either snag attention or cover up something else she had going on.

If CE is to be believed, I wouldn’t doubt some skinheads are involved in meth production and she pissed someone off.

I agree - but personally I don't think it was a ""conspirator"" because I don't think she is tech-savvy enough (as proved by the old texts recovered from the Michigan boyfriend) to arrange all this and not leave a trail by phone records.

Anyway, I think based on the running oddities - I think she was expecting to meet someone - and DID but it went off course and the person she met, then either lured her or forced her to run away...
I think there was some coercion and she was kept against her will - thus the cops have every right to believe her - but she knows who it was, and she was involved in some way with them - sorta like a Patty Hearst scenario.

Now it all hinges on whether she ever comes clean.  If not, then the case is stuck where it's at and there's no leads left to go on.  Her suspicious behavior of ""not being able to recall"", and ""couldn't remember much of what happened"" and now becoming a recluse and hiding - saying nothing - it further support for the argument that she knows the answers but she's determined to keep them all hidden."|3||||0||1510854038.0|0|||False|0|3|Dark theory|49|

Here's JenGam getting her [dream car](https://imgur.com/fMUCxft)  in  April 2015. Notice how she says they will no longer be crowded in one vehicle...a farm truck, no mention of another damn Cadillac! 

So...it *appears* they had enough money to afford a Cadillac (I can't be sure if it's an Escalade or not) many years ago, but she's claiming she made enough money with MILFshakes for CamGam to buy her an Escalade.  I'm sure they just traded in the old one and probably got a bigger payment. You know, like the rest of us do when we need a new car.  All of their so-called hardships are self-made and extremely exaggerated.

He is a compulsive liar and probably meets DSM 5 for sociopath.  He was a bank robber and between the time I realized this (12/31/2014) and the time LE actually caught him (11/10/2015), surprised me. What surprised me even more? The 11/10/2015 arrest was for 5 other felonies, LE couldn’t pinpoint at least 3-5 other bank robberies on him because no forensic trail and he refused to talk. LE put GPS on his car and got him on 5 other random felonies.  He was finally sentenced to 10 years in 8/2017.  Btw... the original bank robbery that I know was him 100%, I handed LE the outfit he was wearing.  It was circumstantial evidence and they couldn’t get him.  What we perceive as common sense arrest worthy, doesn’t always meet legal threshold. Anyway just my two cents 🤓😜|3||||0||False|0|||False|0|3|Was CG Visiting SP After She Disappeared?|48|

When SP went missing I thought for sure she was either killed by her husband or some drifter grabbed her when she went on a jog.  Kidnapping an adult is so uncommon that for the family to claim that made me suspicious.  I thought they must know something otherwise why would they suspect kidnapping?  The statement about her being “out of the state” also seemed very strange given the context.  Elizabeth Smart was 20 miles from her home for 9 months.  Chandra Levy’s remains were found in park a few miles from her apartment a year after she went missing.  Unless SP’s family had some evidence she had left he area than proclaiming that publicly was very shortsighted.

Knowing what we know now it seems like claiming kidnapping was the family’s way of letting the community know that they could call off the search because the family knew SP was not going to be found by a search party scouring the woods around Redding.  Also worth mention that six days after SP disappeared the cops went to Michigan.  The family knew something was up."|13||||0||False|0|||False|0|13|Six days after she went missing, RR3 certain she’s kidnapped - but why?|37|https://i.redditmedia.com/DyIC109Dcrfaupl8RsbwQtXAJBalSfT_QuMvoqLp2Eg.jpg?s=891eddf205e6acd63574645c5e2c0af9

IS NOT proof she wasn't planning to disappear.  If someone is planning a secret rendezvous, they would play the part and do exactly those kinds of things to *""act normal""*.

Then the claim that she *""has never left like this before""* is NOT supported by the testimony of the guy she ran away from home as a teenager and lived with.

My first instinct when I saw the story on the news was that she was taken as part of a gang initiation.  We have a big problem with MS 13 in this area, and two teen girls were found murdered a few months before SP's kidnapping.  But now, after looking into SP's history and the total lack of information that she has provided, I must admit I think it is a hoax as well.  That being said, PLENTY of people in the area still believe her and her story to be true.  |11||||0||False|0|||False|0|11|How many locals are there on the sub?|9|

Let's say SP has a boyfriend or a man of some sort that she's hanging out with while the kids are at daycare.  We know the guy can't meet her at home because they probably have some cameras and of course the neighbors could see this going on, so she ""picks up jogging again"" in order to meet the dude.  She didn't have to meet him on that corner, but it's a good place to 'drop' her phone while she was getting the mail in case KP decided to look for her, worst case if he was asking why she was at the mailboxes so long she could have said she just dropped it there while getting the mail. 




So let's say she drops the phone off there, then maybe even jogs a little further and gets in the dude's car, he's probably not the MM, but a local that she's been hanging out with who is probably married too - perhaps a step above KP but not quite MM level.  Maybe he's delivering something down south, or has to run down there for some reason and she's just going to tag along, these kinds of things happen with affairs where the people just hang out whenever they get a chance. It's maybe 1.5 hours each way, but if she left between 10 or 11am she'd be back in plenty of time to get the kids by 4something.  And if the phones were off it would it would explain her not responding to anyone during that period of time.




Now, let's say at some point, either on the way down or on the way back, Sherri and manpal get in a rather violent wreck, the vehicle is totaled, she took an airbag or dashboard to the face and maybe even broke her nose, she may even be a little concussed.  She panics, how can she possibly explain that she was in an accident with a strange man? Or why she was so far from home... Or why her face is all jacked up...  So she just scurries off before the cops arrive to figure out how she's going to get back home without admitting she was being a degenerate. 

She finds an old tool shed or tack room, probably in Woodland, to hunker down until she can get her story straight and the guts to commit to the kidnap victim role.

But for Victoria Jones, it’s been more useful in communicating mistrust and solitude. After a childhood spent in the foster-care system, she is unable to get close to anybody, and her only connection to the world is through flowers and their meanings. Now eighteen and emancipated from the system with nowhere to go, Victoria realizes she has a gift for helping others through the flowers she chooses for them. But an unexpected encounter with a mysterious stranger has her questioning what’s been missing in her life. And when she’s forced to confront a painful secret from her past, she must decide whether it’s worth risking everything for a second chance at happiness.|5||||0||False|0|||False|0|5|How did you choose your username?

I moved to the big city at 18 to go to university and the most exiting part was not having to worry about things getting back to my parents. I did not know how to act! All of these years later and I miss my old community as much as I used to hate the gossip I think most people intentions were good. 

You have not said anything bad or malicious and you have every right to share your experiences with the Ps and thoughts about this case as much as anyone else. There is no pressure or judgment although I think I can speak for this sub community and say we are very curious about anyone who knew them at anytime. I appreciate that you didn't come on here sensationalizing your experiences with them, so again thanks for contributing and I like your name.

Raised in a small self contained village.  Everyone had a farm outside of the village.  There was timber and mining industry.  All were employed that wanted to be.  I worked for the farmer next door from 12yo summers and weekends.  Now there are no farms, no industry, no jobs, only a grocery, liquor store, and taverns.  The Amazon deliveries come daily like everywhere else.  The welfare and social security checks keep it all going.

I couldn't wait to move away and was an economic refugee with some high school friends until the Army got me and sent me to Vietnam.  After the army I worked underground in a mine for a couple of years but finally got the gumption to go to college.

My work kept me in the Metro areas and I loved the Yuppie life in my 30's and 40's, but there was something in me pulling me back.

I bought a new house in a small Western Washington village 10 years ago and moved out of the city.  This town still is alive although much less so than it was when the timber industry was big.  We do have the forest service, national park, some timber industry, ski area, tourism, and our weekend residents. 

I know at least half of the people in this town and probably more of them know me.  Lot's of rumors about people and most are a distortion of some basic truth.  If you want to know something you ask D...., the town crier.  She usually knows although her facts might be more than a little distorted.  If you have a psychological or marital problem, just tell a friend and soon he/she will spread it to the whole town and everyone will know and accept it and you will be cured.   You're only as sick as your secrets afterall:) Your life is an open book including your escapades that you are not too proud of.   You get so that it doesn't bother.  But people also care a lot more than your neighbor in the next condo in the city, or so it seems.

I picked my handle in haste.  I could think of a better one but I've been here nearly a year.  Had never been on Reddit until the P incident.  I read some of the first revelations and thought the truth would come out on this very soon, but here we are 1 year later, still wondering wtf really happened.

Today I'm going to take a beautiful drive across the mountains 75 miles to the nearest city with big box stores for a medical appointment.  Then I will go to my favorite restaurant and buy a frozen turkey from Costco and maybe do a little more shopping.  Then I will Tank up on cheap gas and come home to the quiet life for another month or so.

I worked for Pioneer corn company from age of 13 but a lot of my friends worked for farmers.

My hometown is dying. Many of us wish we could go back (some stayed, a lot did) but we have good jobs now and feel unless you were established it pretty hard to transition back.  I still have my friends I grew up with in my life and I love them to death. A couple of them came with me to the big city at 18 and we hung on to each other tightly.

Many of our parents left too so we don't have a ""home"" there anymore but even the ones that were gossipy (adults) and not our favorites get all teary when they see us for a homecoming even back home. 

I'm going to leave it here, before I start crying myself.

You could stay in a hotel and not go out unless necessary or have your accomplice bring you food and stuff.

Especially if you are far enough away from home where you won't be running into people who know you. People don't always have the confidence to positively ID a stranger.

A lot of people hide in plain sight. It's does take confidence I don't know if Sherri possesses.

The most extreme case I think of and not compare to SP is Pablo Escobar he had US delta forces and the Colombian army (trained by delta forces) hunting him for 9 years after he left the prison he built.

I think you're definitely in the ballpark. We still don't know if she was ever able to meet with the dude from Michigan (or if he's a doctor for sure) but law enforcement said there was no evidence they ever met up, which doesn't mean they didn't.  They did say he was in California in the days leading up to her disappearance, or something along those lines.  Again, we don't really know how some of this really translates but my initial take on it was that he left town prior to the 2nd. 



But you know what, I think you just turned a lightbulb on in my brain.  She could have easily taken a private/chartered plane either out of Sacramento or possibly straight out of Redding.

I remember RRIII writing about how incredible a mom she was because she rented a hall for one of her kid's 2nd birthday and invited all the kids from preschool and was ""master of ceremonies"" and had gift bags so every kid would be able to take trinkets home, blah blah blah.  It was bizarre, because moms everywhere do stuff like that all the time, but it doesn't make them mother of the year.  

I don't believe she meant to leave Keith and the kids that day for good.  It's just a gut feeling.

I think things were getting boring at home for sure.  Her sister was pregnant and getting all of the attention.  She had too much time on her hands.  Her in-laws were smotherers, and besides, she already had their adoration.  Her husband turned her off big time.

Even if she was not the Supermom she had been portrayed to be, it takes a cold heart to walk away from babies that don't know any better.

You all know what we think of Moms who walk away from their babies. They are the lowest form of dirt. Crack Moms have to have their kids wrested away from them and many spend the rest of the lives fighting the system to get them back, even when they should not ever be permitted to be around them.

Tired of all the “illness” label and everyone has a “sickness”. I want to scream “a sickness that you continually choose to bring into yourself and have others especially your kids pay the price.” When is responsibility and truth going to become fashionable again. Sorry, I’m not a fan of being “PC” I think we would get a lot more done and in a more efficient manner if we didn’t placate everyone who clearly CHOOSEs bad behavior then feels they deserve some sort of free pass because it’s an addiction, an illness, ainsert your own of the moment label that gets you out of responsibility. I don’t care what condition she has. If she left on her own accord then the fallout is on her. She’s a mother for Pete’s sake. Don’t breed if you can’t handle putting your children’s lives before your own. In my large family we have everything from bi-polar to schizophrenia, to drug addiction and even one with dissociative personality. None other than the Meth user distance relatives would screw their families over like this. Heck, now that I think of it, both the meth folks gave their children to be adopted by grandparents soon after birth so they wouldn’t be around anything crazy. No excuses. Reasons, regrets, truth? People can deal with that. Honestly admitting you have a problem? Most families will help you get through. At the very least there are friends, churches, etc. Papini has all of the support and love most people would died to have in their corner to help get them through difficulties. Sherri? Won’t give them even the truth. Nothing but take, poor me, take, poor me. Heck she won’t even provide proof it actually happened. Sorry I am on a rant. I have stayed quiet for so long trying to give her the benefit of the doubt even though my investigative training has been scream HOAX since the phone was found. When the husband opened his mouth- that was enough for me. I hate people who are simply immoral usually excuses especially “mental health” which is used too broadly and mistakenly in my view to excuse a stupid selfish act by a narcissistic proven liar who though obviously can bake a pie, totally sucks at being a good wife and mother. Yes, all moms get bored, need a break, Miss their careers. Good moms don’t take off- ever. Good wives and moms don’t screw around on their husbands, Chase other men, go anywhere near drugs, or pawn off their kids every single day during their formative bonding and trust developing years.  This woman deserves not even sympathy at this point as anyone who has gone through any even remotely similar to what she said she experienced would be doing everything possible to trudge up details or memories of any kind to keep these evil “kidnappers” from coming back for her family or another innocent. She’s just spouting bull and her weenie husband made it worse by his tactics and now feels partly responsible and they just wish it would go away. I am very worried for their children and wish the grandparents had them. I know this is long, but I think people are too quick to A. Label uncomfortable behavior as mental illness, and B. Look for excuses for people who regardless of illness or shortcomings or anything else are just being selfish immoral douchebags. It’s not always the fault of any condition other than being selfish. Now her history speaks to what she’s willing to do to get her way, but it’s not an illness making these choices.|2||||0||False|0|||False|0|2|Thoughts on case|60|

Personally I am happy to hear from people who have met SP and trust the mods behind screen vetting, since it's asking a lot of someone to publicly release personal details.

And I definitely understand apprehension concerning troll type accounts looking steer the conversation, as they hate free thought.  Conversely, I trust my instincts in these type of information releases.

I'm excited, even for the limited value it can add.

It surprises me that people question whether a mother could leave her kids. 

Mothers kill their kids. They abuse their kids. Neglect them. They allow their new men to molest, beat, torture, rape and slaughter their kids. 

They molest their own children on film for some dude they're chatting with online. 

They prostitute their kids for money and thrills.

There were several years of posting history. Sorry we can't show you that because it has identifiers that could link back to the person. More about their verification and background can be discussed in the AMA.

The AMA is just locked because we don't want this user to be overwhelmed with questions to respond to before the AMA even starts. Please hold your questions to ask during the AMA. If anybody knows they can't be online at the time, you are welcome to send a mod mail with your question, and the mods will present it during the chat.

For the most part I am confident you guys (the mods) are doing the right thing. I’m just super turned off by a lot of the posts here lately. It just seems like people are getting a little too into the case and it’s coming across as frankly psycho. I’ve been here from the beginning so it’s not like I’m not used to it. But some posters are coming across as a little too intense and it’s cringey and awkward. at least to me. I mean I don’t want SPs life to be ruined. We all have our issues. My life doesn’t revolve around bringing SP down and embarrassing her and her family. This is coming from someone who doesn’t believe shit that’s been told to us and never has. But when anyone expresses ideas that aren’t off the wall, they are accused of being weird or uninformed.

He just always seemed like a genuinely friendly, down to earth guy and was always happy to just shoot the shit with anyone after the shows (one night I was just making light chat, and a fan came up and asked for any advice on breaking into the music business, and Rodney ended up sitting down with him and giving him a ton of ideas and tips... not the usual bullshit).
That said, he was on a tour bus and would show up day of. Sometimes he'd fly in and out. But he wouldn't need to be at any venue more than a day to allow for a soundcheck before the show, so in this case I don't see why he'd have needed to come into Redding earlier in the month.

I'd need to watch more and closer, but again, so far nothing I see that disproves this theory."|5||||0||False|0|||False|0|5|Rodney Atkins Concert, 11/13/16 at the Redding Civic Auditorium|24|https://i.redditmedia.com/8-5ukJfJLtbw1E4T-E6TH9N4FXRKf_OAWGhQ3G-_9no.jpg?s=283dbe55f3a08013c22ee3822b3c6b68

He might have cancelled last minute and flew back to Michigan and she had already been picked up and was in transit.  Lt. Bertain seemed to be adamant early on that she was missing voluntarily and it might have been because he had read her texts.  My weak spot with this one is that she didn't seem to have a travel bag or money unless she had squirreled that away somewhere in preparation.

She could have been mixed up in something where her business associates sent their representatives to pick her up for a meet.  They could have coerced her into taking a ride with them but probably not at gunpoint.

In the case above it's possible that she wasn't free to leave until some obligation was met and that she truly was kept against her will.  That could have been physical constraints our just coercion.  Maybe the cops are leaning that way.

I still think that some of that $50k family reward money could have been paid to meet her obligations and expedite the Thanksgiving miracle.  Perhaps all handled by a 3rd party.

My 3rd scenario is that KP new about MM and they had been fighting about it for a while and she told him that she planned to meet with him.  When the time came and MM had his ""family emergency"" and cancelled, she didn't want to give KP the satisfaction.  Her ride had already been arranged so she just modified her plans.  Supposedly she had other prospects in her daytimer.

If she wasn't truly abducted, after KP upped the ante by calling 911 and this became a national woman hunt, the only way she could come home is abused and chained and left beside the highway.  She couldn't very well waltz in like she had just been on a business trip, put dinner on the stove, and ask KP what he and the children had been doing while she was gone.

My 4th scenario is that she all along planned the GFM scam and maybe to run a scam on her family also, but I think that's more unlikely.

This isn't just for observation, its also for a case worker, psychologist and -perhaps- police time to ask and interrogate for more information. Its a way for authorities to 'get the bad guy' and get relevant information out of the victim/patient. The only way around it is when the patient refuses medical treatment. In short, makes no sense why a mom of 2 who supposedly was taken against her will would not want a full rape kit preformed and some much-needed help after coughing up blood (insert eye-roll here). |9||||0||False|0|||False|0|9|Was SP ever held against her will, at any time during her disappearance?|31|

Let’s say both those men are average U.S. male height, CG would probably reach 5’4” if he stood very straight with his heels ever so slightly lifted off the ground. I knew a pilot who wore Dr. Scholl’s heel pads inside his socks when he went to his yearly flight physical. He was borderline when he entered the military and the g’s slowly altered his overall height ever so slightly. 

Furthermore, there’s nothing of a follow on to this channel...onepercentertv.com. The address goes nowhere or a GoDaddy.com add about purchasing the domain appears. It seem the boys, fresh out of college, maybe attempted a start-up production company and failed. Isn’t it slightly ironical CG would be interviewed by them? Grant money doesn’t go very far these days...also an assumption by the way they dressed for the photo shoot on the roof. They did have one Tweet. Guessing cam was their one and only interview and they closed shop before the segment was edited and put on the “interweb” forevermore. Maybe all of this was the “big thing coming” which JG seemed to be talking about!?!

Edit: Looked at a better quality Instagram photo and CG is standing on his toes. That and he’s flexing his ”rockin bod” forearms to establish some sort of dominance. Like their company mission statement. “This is a millennials view of the one percenter. We're trying to Humanize the professional world, and bring personality back to corporate America.” #CEO of what...a phony internet persona?
