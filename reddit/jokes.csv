35,c9lphar,"A store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City, where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions
at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:


You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and different products are offered as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men have good jobs

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men have good jobs and are attractive.

'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men have good jobs and are attractive and love kids.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men have good jobs and are attractive and love kids and help with the housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men have good jobs and are attractive and love kids and help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.


PLEASE NOTE:

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that were attractive and well proportioned.

The second floor has wives that were attractive and well proportioned and love sex.

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.

He walks up to the first man who is a nerdy, bookish sort in a bad business suit and says, ""Tell me your story.""

""Okay,"" says the man. ""I thought I had a wonderful life. I had a beautiful wife and we had a lovely place on the 34th floor of an apartment building. I came home from work early today, and I saw my beautiful wife sleeping naked in bed with another man's clothes on the floor. So of course I started looking for the bastard who slept with my wife."" 

""Like I said, I lived in an apartment. There weren't that many places to hide, but I couldn't find him anywhere! Just when I was about to go confront my wife, I see him. The bastard was hiding outside the window, holding onto the windowsill. I go up to him and started stomping on his hands over and over again, but he wouldn't let go. I finally kicked him in the face and he fell. Unfortunately, he landed on a bush and bounced to safety. In my anger, I grabbed my refrigerator and throw it out after him. However, the cord from the refrigerator wrapped around my leg and pulled me to my death.""

St. Peter nods and says, ""You're story is acceptable. Welcome to heaven."" He goes to the second man a brawny working-man type and says, ""What's your story?""

""I'm a window washer,"" says the man. ""I've been a window washer for over 20 years. Well today, I'm washing the windows of the 35th floor of this apartment building when my scaffolding breaks. I thought I was going to die, but I manage to catch myself on the windowsill of the story below. All of a sudden this maniac comes out and starts mashing my fingers. I try my best to hold on, but he kicks me in the face and I fall. Once again, I thought I was going to die, but I land on this hedge and bounce away no worse for the wear. I look up and BOOM. Dead. Last thing I saw was a refrigerator.""

St. Peter holds back a chuckle and lets him into heaven. He goes to the third man, a ridiculously handsome fellow with sandy-blonde hair, and asks, ""What's your story?""

When he gets to the counter, the first thing he asks the bartender is ""hey barkeep, what's that jar of money for? looks far too large to be an average tip jar."" The bartender casually cleaning out a few glasses ready for beverages gladly explains. ""Well you see, that's our prize jar. So to speak, and in that jar is 10,000 dollars cold hard cash, and you could win it all ya know"". After hearing the staggering amount of cash he could possibly obtain, the man nods for the bartender to continue. ""Well it's pretty simple really. There are three tasks you gotta accomplish. First one is you have to eat this whole jar of hot chili peppers, you can't eat or drink anything else with them either."" Thinking this could be easier than he thought, the man perks up more and listens closer. ""Second thing that you have to is go out back where our pitbull is tied up, and pull his rotten tooth."" Losing interest quickly but his curiosity getting the better of him, the man asks what the third task is. ""This last one's a kicker! Last thing you gotta do is go directly across the street to this little old ladies house, she's never been screwed in her life an you have to fuck her brains out."" Completely put off by now the man pays for the drinks and joins his buddies for a few rounds. Half an hour and several shots later, the man stumbles up to the barkeep and says ""gimme them hot peppers!"" He downs the whole jar without skipping a beat, no flinching, no sweating, no choking, nothing but the sound of peppers being mutilated. After finishing up, the noticeably impressed barkeep directs the drunk man to the back door. After he shuts the door behind the man a struggle can clearly be heard. The dog is barking and howling, the man grunting and groaning, truly a magnificent battle between man and beast is taking place. After a solid 15 minutes of struggle, there is nothing but silence with a decent sized crowd growing, watching the back door for any signs of life the man opens the door and stumbles inside, his clothes are tattered and torn, he has bruises and bites from head to toe. After a minute of catching his breath the man looks over to the bartender and says through a slightly slurred voice ""alright, now wheres that old lady that needs her tooth pulled!"" ..

""Well, you see."" the drunk replies. ""There is this ventilation shaft straight below this window, and the stream of air is so strong, it slows you down enough to land safely on the grid. Why don't you try it yourselves?"" 

So, both the men hurry to the window and jump out, facing certain death as they hit the street at high speed. 

At this point, the bartender walks up to the drunk and says: ""You're a real dick when you're drunk, Superman."""

A businessman was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew
his wife would have a hard time being faithful while he was gone so he
decided to go to a sex shop to find something to entertain her.  As he
browsed through all the different toys the old man behind the counter asked
if he needed help.  He explained his situation and the old man said, ""Well,
I don't really know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks,
except... ahhh... never mind.""
    ""Except what?"" the man asked.
    ""Nothing, nothing.""
    ""C'mon, tell me!""
    ""Well, there is VooDoo Dick.""
    ""What's VooDoo Dick?"" the man replied.
    ""It can't be described"" said the old man, ""it can only be witnessed.""
 So the old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box, 
carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very
ordinary-looking black dildo.
    The businessman laughed, and said, ""That's it?""
    The old man replied, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.""  The old
man pointed to a door across the room and said, ""VooDoo Dick, the door.""
 VooDoo Dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started
screwing the keyhole.  The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack 
developed down the middle.  Before the door could break, the old man said,
""VooDoo Dick, get back in your box!""   VooDoo dick stopped, floated back to
the box and lay there, quiet once again.
    ""I'll take it!"" said the businessman.  The old man resisted, saying it
wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $1000 in cash.  The guy took
it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all 
she had to do was say ""VooDoo Dick, my pussy.""  He left for his trip
satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.
    After he'd been gone for a week, the wife was unbearably horny. She
thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she
remembered VooDoo Dick.  She got it out laid down on the bed and said,
""VooDoo Dick, my pussy!""    The VooDoo Dick shot to her crotch.  It was
great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.  After three orgasms, she 
decided she'd had enough, and tried to stop it, but she couldn't, her
husband had forgot to tell her how to stop it!
    She decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help.  She tried
to get dressed as best as she could with a skirt and a top, but VooDoo Dick
just wouldn't stop and she had yet another orgasm, weakening her knees.
    Finally she got her clothes on, made it to the car and started to drive
to the hospital.  On the way, another orgasm made her swerve into oncoming
traffic, then back to her side of the road, narrowly missing a car.  Next
thing she knew there was a police car behind her with it's blue lights
flashing. The police officer asked for her license, and wanted to know how
much she'd had to drink.    Gasping and twitching, she explained that she
hadn't been drinking and tried to explain the problem of VooDoo Dick.
    The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, ""Yeah, right

At a rental home we moved into for 7 months while we built our new home was pretty shitty. It was directly across the street from our old home, and was pretty much the only option. While scrounging around the place (It was a 50 some-odd year-old home) I found a laptop case with a laptop in it, it was a [Toshiba T-1910](http://acagle.net/images/ToshibaT1910.jpg) It was a pretty heavy rig, I brought it back to my room, and turned it on. It loaded at a decent rate, and was surprisingly well-taken care of and in overall good shape, no glitches (It had Linux on it, I think) I began exploring the files, played a game or two, and launched the ""emails"" folder. There were hundreds! These things dated back to about 1987-1990, and all addressed to this person who was pregnant at the time (All the emails in there were regarding the child, baby shower stuff, where to go to school, possible abortion, etc), and she was receiving these joke emails daily from the same guy that contained one joke each. One of the ones that stood out to me was this:

""...*A lady was driving down a country road, doing the speed limit, and was enjoying the drive, suddenly, a rabbit jumps out in front of the car, she has no time to react, and hits the rabbit killing it instantly. Absolutely horrified that she just killed a rabbit, she pulls over, and cries in her car. About 5 minutes later, a priest happens to drive by, notices her, and stops. He comes to her window, and asks ""My dear child, why are you crying?"" The lady responds through her sobs: ""I hit a rabbit!"". The priest says not a word, and proceeds back to his car, opens the back, grabs a spray can, and walks over to the rabbit. The lady, now out of her car, is watching the priest spray the rabbit with the can. Some time passes and the rabbit springs back to life, dusts itself off, and runs for about 50 feet, stops, and waves. The rabbit repeats this until they can no longer see the rabbit. The lady, now awestruck, ask the priest in a shaky voice: ""What did you do? What is in that can?"" The priest hands her the can, and the lady reads aloud: ""... Super Hair, will bring any hair back to life and adds permanent wave."".*

She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work.

Bob was visiting his friend John at home. When John received him he told him - ""Come here, let me show you some trick!"" And they went back to the yard.

John then whistles and a huge crocodile comes out of nowhere; he grabs a whip and goes *WHOOOPAAA!* (because, you know, that's the sound whips make)

The crocodile immediately goes full rage/defensive mode.

Again, *WHOOOPAAA!*, and the croc then gets submissive.

John gets his pants off and then *WHOOOPAAA!*, and the croc comes slowly and kisses the John's junk.

Bob was shocked by seeing such a freak show when John says: ""Cool huh? do you wanna try it?""

Bob says: ""Gee, I don't know""

John: ""come on! don't be a wuss""

-It was autumn, and members of a Native American tribe asked their new Chief if the coming winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was a new Chief in a modern society and had never been taught the old secrets of Nature, he looked up at the sky and had no clue what to do. To play it safe, he replied to his tribe that the winter could definitely be cold and that they should collect firewood early, just to be prepared. So, the members began gathering wood.Being a practical leader, he figured he should also use the resources available to the modern society. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, 

""Will this winter be cold?""

""As of now, it looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,"" the forecaster said.

So the Chief went back to his tribe and told them to collect even more wood. A week later he called the National Weather Service again and asked for an update.

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""based on incoming data, this winter is looking to be colder than we expected."" The Chief was surprised, but again went back to his tribe, told them that this might be a very cold winter, and asked them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

One week later, the Chief called the National Weather Service yet again, hoping for a new answer. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Positive,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

""Really?"" the shocked Chief exclaimed. ""How can you be so sure?""

""First,"" the forecaster replied, ""The Indians are collecting firewood like crazy."""

The american was hiding in the first. But he was smart and said ""Chirp Chirp"" and whistled. ""Must be some birds"" the cops below said, and moved on to poke on the next tree.

The chinese, who spoke no english, was surprised to see a stick poking him, but he was wise and ""meowww""-ed. The cops below thought it was a cat, so they moved on to the last tree where the irish was hiding.

The fish sees the fly and says to himself, ""You know, that fly's gonna get thirsty pretty soon and fly down to the lake to get a drink. And when he does, I'll jump up and eat him."" The fish was quite content with his plan. On the bank of the lake there's a big bear. He sees the fly and thinks to himself, ""That fly's gonna get thirsty and fly down to the water and get a drink. And when he does, I bet a fish is gonna jump up to eat the fly. And when he does I'll grab the fish and have a nice snack."" Behind the bear is a little mouse.

And when he does that bear is gonna eat the fish and spit the guts out behind him. Then I'll eat the guts and be a fat happy mouse."" Now behind the mouse there's a cat hiding in the tall grass. The cat sees the fly, the bear, and the mouse and says to himself, ""I bet that fly's gonna get thirsty and fly down to the water and get a drink. And when he does, I bet a fish is gonna jump up to eat the fly. And when he does that bear is gonna eat the fish and spit the guts out behind him. Then the mouse is gonna eat the guts and I'll grab the cat and have a nice dinner."" So eventually the fly gets thirsty and goes down to the water to get a drink. The fish jumps up and eats the fly. The bear grabs the fish, eats it, and spits out the guts behind him. The mouse eats the guts and gets nice and fat. Then, the cat pounces, misses the mouse and falls in the lake.

And so another week goes by, and another, and another, into a month, and then two months, and then three and, all the time, the bartender keeps telling the guy that the only game in town is the barrel out back. 

So, finally, one night, the guy drinks up, slams down his glass, and goes out back. 

When he comes back, the bartender asks ""how was it?"" 

The guy smiles and says ""it was the best I've ever had. Can I do that every night?"" 

The bartender says ""sure, every night but Tuesday."" 

The guy asks ""why not Tuesday?""

The Jew asked: “Tell me my son, when a man [naturally] enters the Roman Catholic church, what does he become?”

He pauses for effect. “He has a parish and a flock of the faithful, he has complete responsibility for their lives and their religious welfare. The priest has an immense responsibility for ensuring that his flock and their offspring all successfully enter Heaven at the end of their lives. The role of the priest is crucial to the understanding and the practise of the Roman Catholic faith.” The Roman Catholic thinks to himself that no one could possibly argue with that.

The Jew replies, “Priest, shmeest, small potatoes, is there nothing more?”

The Roman Catholic becomes a little agitated and begins somewhat tersely, “Look, if you are an immensely holy man and are looked on benignly by the Almighty, you may become a bishop.” He pauses for effect. “As a bishop you have a diocese, you have many priests and parishes to administer and the strains and demands are exceptional, but you draw your strength from the Almighty and He sustains you.” The Roman Catholic utters these last words with emphasis.

The Jew is not impressed. “Bishop, schishop, pointy hat, they are four to the dime. Nothing else?

The Roman Catholic is becoming enraged. “Look,” he says loudly, “if you have pushed the boundaries of holiness to their limits, and for all your life you have honored and worshipped Our Blessed Saviour with every breath that you have ever taken, then you may be made a Cardinal and be called to the Holy City of the Vatican where your role will be only slightly lower than the very Hosts of Heaven!” The Roman Catholic is exhausted, but satisfied that he has won.

The Jew replies, “Cardinal, yes, nice red hat, nice red frock, nice piece of income for not doing a lot. But is that it?

The Roman Catholic is approaching a heart attack, but he continues to drive on. “Listen to me, listen to me! If you are beyond holiness itself, and if you are a man in one-two-thousand-million and you hear the voice of God Almighty from when you awake in the morning to when you rest your head at night, and also your soul is more pure than starlight, you may stand a chance of becoming POPE!” The Roman Catholic slumps exhausted.

an enormous humanoid, three miles high and made of granite. At first it is
mistaken for an immense statue left by some vanished race of giants, for it
squats motionless on a yellow plain, exhibiting no outward sign of life. It has
legs, but it never rises to walk on them. It has a mouth, but never eats or
speaks. It has what appears to be a perfectly functional brain, the size of a
four-story condominium, but the organ lies dormant, electrochemical activity at
a standstill. Yet it lives.

This puzzles the hell out of the scientists, who try everything they can think
of to get some sign of life from the behemoth – in vain. It just squats,
motionless and seemingly thoughtless, until one day a xenobiologist, frustrated
beyond endurance, screams, “How could evolution give legs, mouth and brain to a
creature that doesn't use them?”

It happens that he's the first one to ask a direct question in the thing's
presence. It rises with a thunderous rumble to its full height, scattering the
clouds, thinks for a second, booms, “IT COULDN'T”, and squats down again.
