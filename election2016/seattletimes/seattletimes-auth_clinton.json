In addition to showing the internal strategizing, sniping and off-the-cuff commentary within Hillary Clinton\u2019s inner circle, the emails begin to paint a portrait of her guarded and private daughter as she set about her goal, as she explained in one email, of \u201cprotecting my father and the nonprofit status of the foundation.\u201d</p>", "<p>As Chelsea Clinton asserted herself at the Clinton Foundation, eager to embrace her role as a board member and de facto heir, she became concerned about what seemed to her to be a lack of professionalism and a blurring of the lines between the foundation\u2019s philanthropic activities and some of its leaders\u2019 business interests.</p>", "<p>\u201cMy only objectives were to take stock, professionalize the foundation, build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his work and my mom\u2019s,\u201d Chelsea Clinton wrote in an email to her parents\u2019 closest advisers in November 2011, about the time she enlisted outside lawyers to examine the foundation\u2019s practices.</p>", "<p>Though her housecleaning role had Hillary Clinton\u2019s tacit approval (\u201cMy mother strongly agreed,\u201d Chelsea Clinton said in one email laying out proposed changes at the foundation), it proved not to be so simple. Her efforts set off a cascade of grievances, gossip and infighting as her ascendance diminished longtime aides Bill Clinton often referred to as surrogate children.</p>", "<p>Chelsea Clinton had already started to fret about the intermingling of foundation business with Teneo, the corporate consulting firm co-founded by Douglas Band, one of her father\u2019s closest aides. She suggested an audit of the charity and wrote that she was concerned that Teneo\u2019s principals had been \u201chustling\u201d business at foundation gatherings.</p>", "<p>Chelsea Clinton, 31 at the time, had held various jobs, including positions at McKinsey and Avenue Capital, a hedge fund owned by a major Clinton donor. She had degrees from Stanford, Oxford and Columbia but had not quite found a way to harness her academic wherewithal.</p>", "<p>To Band, who had remained loyal to Bill Clinton when others abandoned him post-impeachment and who was instrumental in building the Clinton Foundation from scratch, Chelsea Clinton seemed like a dilettante.</p>", "<p>In response to the scrutiny, Band wrote a 13-page memo outlining how he had raised many millions of dollars for the foundation from Teneo\u2019s corporate clients, including Coca-Cola and Dow Chemical, without taking a fee. In the memo, which WikiLeaks released this week, Band also described arranging tens of millions of dollars in income for Bill Clinton in the form of lucrative speeches and consulting arrangements, some of them from foundation donors.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the president and his family \u2014 for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like,\u201d Band wrote.</p>", "<p>The subtext was clear: Where Chelsea Clinton saw a messy overlapping of business and charity that could haunt both parents, Band saw an ungrateful daughter who was naive about how what he called \u201cBill Clinton Inc.\u201d made its money, and how her own expensive lifestyle was funded.</p>", "<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think any of this is right and that we should be treated this way when no one else is, only because CVC has nothing better to do and need justify her existence,\u201d he wrote in one email, using the initials for Chelsea Victoria Clinton.</p>", "<p>Band, who had already planned to leave the foundation to focus on Teneo, often expressed frustration at the global charity\u2019s nepotism, pointing to Chelsea Clinton\u2019s installing her friends in central roles.</p>", "<p>In a new statement Thursday, Band said that Teneo, \u201cnever received any financial benefit or benefit of any kind\u201d for its work for the Clinton Foundation. He did not elaborate about what gifts Bill Clinton obtained from his speech and consulting clients.</p>", "<p>Bill Clinton, who does not use email, is almost absent in the battles, mentioned only in passing as \u201cDad\u201d or by his initials, \u201cWJC.\u201d</p>", "<p>In another email, Chelsea Clinton alludes to her father\u2019s feelings about the tensions at his foundation. \u201cDoug apparently kept telling my dad I was trying to push him out, take over \u2014 and Dad kept asking him \u2014 has she said that to you? To anyone? She\u2019s never said it to me,\u201d she wrote.

But balancing expectations with gender role reversals\u00a0is\u00a0something women leaders have faced for decades. </p>", "<p>Recently, three women executives told me\u00a0about the lesser-talked-about downsides\u00a0of being the only woman in a leadership team.</p>", "<p>One C-level executive said she recently had to consider logistics\u00a0during a company off-site that her male peers would never have to. Questions she pondered: Who she would spend time with during activities \u2014 her male colleagues or the female spouses? As she was single, who would she bring to the offsite \u2014 would a friend be OK?</p>", "<p>\u201cThis is\u00a0just a normal part of my challenge,\u201d she tells me. \u201cFor example, I don\u2019t get invited out to drinks often with the group, and I can\u2019t tell if that is because I\u2019m the only woman or something else. But, I\u2019m regularly not included.\u201d </p>", "<p>To combat this,\u00a0companies must be intentional in\u00a0planning inclusive activities.

Women are making progress at a glacial pace \u2014 a paltry 14.2 percent of the top five positions in the S&amp;P 500 are held by women. But by normalizing more women in all aspects\u00a0of office culture, we\u2019re likely to see more women advance.\u00a0To ensure more women join the executive ranks, it behooves companies to create a culture where having more women leaders\u00a0is just no big deal.</p>", "<p>I\u2019m hopeful for a world where\u00a0we don\u2019t bat an eyelid when a male leader\u2019s role includes picking\u00a0out White House china patterns.

Kennedy, a senior State Department official, called him in spring 2015 looking for help in getting the FBI to agree not to classify the disputed email. McCauley said he agreed to try to help him if Kennedy, in turn, would help him get the State Department to restore two spots that the FBI had lost recently in the Baghdad embassy.</p>", "<p>\u201cI\u2019m the one that threw that out there,\u201d McCauley said. He said the offer was typical of how federal agencies \u201chelp each other and work with each other.\u201d</p>", "<p>In that initial conversation, McCauley said, \u201cit was a quid pro quo; I don\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p>", "<p>McCauley said he quickly reversed himself, however, after calling another FBI official and learning that the email in question involved the Benghazi attack \u2014 a political weapon for Republicans against Clinton.</p>", "<p>At that point, McCauley said, he abandoned any thought of exchanging favors, and he said he called Kennedy immediately to tell him that he could not help.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt was off the table; the quid pro quo was not even close to being considered,\u201d McCauley said.</p>", "<p>His account was largely consistent with that of Kennedy, who made his first public comment on the controversy in a written statement put out Tuesday by the State Department, a day after the email episode emerged in new documents released by the FBI.</p>", "<p>The FBI documents did not name McCauley; The Washington Post first named him and interviewed him about his account Tuesday.</p>", "<p>Kennedy, who also did not name McCauley in his statement, said he had made the call last year to the FBI official for help because he \u201cwanted to better understand\u201d why the bureau wanted to classify a portion of the Benghazi email before it was released to the public.</p>", "<p>Like McCauley, he said the issue of the FBI\u2019s positions in Baghdad came up in the conversation, but he said that there was never an implicit or explicit offer to exchange favors.</p>", "<p>\u201cAt no point in our conversation was I under the impression we were bargaining,\u201d he said, adding that in nearly four decades in the Foreign Service, he had served Democratic and Republican administrations. \u201cMy motivations were never political,\u201d Kennedy said.</p>", "<p>He said he did not believe the information should be classified as \u201csecret,\u201d but should instead be redacted, or blacked out, on the grounds that it contained information related to a continuing investigation.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe take very seriously our responsibility to decide whether our documents are classified or not classified,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe can\u2019t simply cede that responsibility to another agency.\u201d</p>", "<p>McCauley said he remembered Kennedy\u2019s telling him in their initial phone conversation that he wanted to redact part of the email on different grounds so that it could be \u201cburied in the basement\u201d of the State Department.</p>", "<p>But State Department officials denied any intention to bury the email. In the end, the State Department accepted the bureau\u2019s argument and released the email with a sentence redacted as secret because it related to the FBI\u2019s Clinton email investigation.</p>", "<p>Even so, Republicans continued to focus on Kennedy\u2019s handling of the emails. Donald Trump, for a second day, said Tuesday that Clinton\u2019s email server was a scandal \u201cworse than Watergate.\u201d Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asked the Justice Department on Tuesday to open a criminal investigation into Kennedy and his role in the purported quid pro quo.</p>", "<p>\u201cUndersecretary Kennedy\u2019s attempt to barter away American national security interests for plainly political purposes is appalling and may rise to the level of a federal crime,\u201d Goodlatte wrote in the letter.</p>", "<p>President Barack Obama, appearing with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy at the White House, dismissed the controversy over the FBI documents when asked if it disturbed him.</p>", "<p>\u201cBased on what we have seen, heard, learned, some of the more sensational implications or appearances, as you stated them, aren\u2019t based on actual events and based on what actually happened,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think derive from sort of overly broad characterizations of interactions between the State Department and the FBI that happen a lot and happen between agencies.\u201d</p>", "<p>McCauley saw the episode in much the same way.</p>", "<p>Trump and other Republicans, he said, \u201care grasping at straws. There was no political motivation in this at all.\u201d</p>", "<p>McCauley retired from the FBI last summer after 35 years because of a medical issue. He said his retirement was unrelated to the email episode.</p>", "<p>FBI officials said that while they referred the quid pro quo accusation to their inspections branch for an ethics review as a matter of policy, the issue became moot because McCauley had left the bureau.

The people who were physically closest to the candidate knew the least about what was happening.</p>", "<p>It wasn\u2019t until the plane landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, about an hour later, that they could get clearer details about how the FBI was examining additional emails they had discovered during an unrelated investigation.</p>", "<p>Now there was a new question: When to tell Clinton? They hadn\u2019t yet told the nominee, who had spent the flight with a childhood friend.</p>", "<p>Famed photographer Annie Leibovitz was onboard, and she was supposed to spend a few minutes taking pictures of Clinton once the plane landed.

If she was bothered, she was determined not to show it when she stepped off the plane.</p>", "<p>Reporters standing under the wing shouted questions, but she just smiled and waved before stepping into an SUV and being whisked to her first rally of the day. Clinton didn\u2019t say a word about the FBI investigation in Cedar Rapids, nor did she mention it at a second event at a Des Moines school.</p>", "<p>By now, new details had emerged. The FBI review was tied to a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of close Clinton aide Huma Abedin, over whether he broke the law by sending sexual text messages to a 15-year-old, a sordid case now merging with the long-running drama over Clinton\u2019s private email server.</p>", "<p>As she often does, Abedin was traveling with Clinton on Friday. I saw her from a distance outside the rally in Des Moines, a stricken look on her face as she held a phone to her ear.</p>", "<p>Once the event was over, reporters were ushered out of the gymnasium and into another room that had been decorated with flags and campaign signs. Clinton would make a statement and take a few questions.</p>", "<p>Although she was criticized last year for a leaden response as the controversy over her emails began to swirl, Clinton and her campaign were determined to stay on top of this story with a little more than a week until Election Day.

Both have made Washington state visits while campaigning, including pricey fundraisers with high-profile, local donors.</p>", "<p>Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/libertarian-gary-johnson-to-greet-supporters-in-seattle-today/\" class=\"content-link\">made a local stop</a>, too.</p>", "<p>Like Steward, Hanen said her conservative views fall into the minority in the suburb north of Seattle. In the living room of the Edmonds condo which she shares with her husband, the mother and son one recent afternoon confronted their differences. They agreed their different experiences have shaped their views.</p>", "<p>\u201cWhat he has grown up and observed has been drastically different with what I have grown up with,\u201d the mother said.</p>", "<p>A student of international studies, among other topics, the son temporarily stayed in the home after his 11-month trip in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) before moving near the university for graduate classes in September. During his time in the suburb, though, he briefly moved in with a friend in Seattle\u2019s Wallingford neighborhood, in part to escape Trump discussions.</p>", "<p>To some of Hanen\u2019s remarks, specifically on the issue of transgender bathrooms, Simpson was speechless. To her comment on Obama\u2019s impact on the nation\u2019s debt, he fought back. At one point, while passionately recalling his frustration after turning on the television to find Fox News as the last channel played, the son paused, saying:</p>", "<p>\u201cAt the same time, I\u2019m very lucky to stay here \u2014 it\u2019s a beautiful place \u2014 I don\u2019t want to wear out my welcome. It\u2019s home.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cWell, you can never wear out your welcome,\u201d Hanen responded, as if to remind him they\u2019re family.</p>", "<p><em>Is the presidential election straining your relationships?

Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s circle of advisers and donors has turned to how she can make a dignified exit from the race.</p>", "<p>Outwardly, Clinton operated Thursday as if the disappointing results from Indiana and North Carolina never happened. She made stops in West Virginia, South Dakota and Oregon, while her husband held a conference call with top fundraisers. Before dawn, one of her advisers, Mark Penn, crafted a memo to outline the campaign\u2019s strategy.</p>", "<p>But for all the signs of normalcy, much of the infrastructure that keeps the Clinton campaign going \u2014 the aides, donors and political allies \u2014 is resigned to the reality that the Democratic nomination is out of reach.</p>", "<p>\u201cThere is a profound sadness [among the staff],\u201d one Clinton aide said Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone sees that there\u2019s a clear path to victory here.\u201d</p>", "<p>Richard Schiffrin, a national finance co-chairman for Clinton, is scheduled to meet with other fundraisers and her next week. He said he will tell her: \u201cLet\u2019s look at the situation as it exists and think about whether there\u2019s a credible path to the nomination, and if there isn\u2019t, what\u2019s Plan B?</p>", "<p>\u201cThe bottom line is she\u2019s going to make a decision that in my view will be in the best interests of the party and the country.\u201d</p>", "<p>Clinton on Thursday launched a three-state, 21-hour, cross-country marathon campaign swing. Speaking to several hundred supporters in Charleston, W.Va., Clinton acknowledged she has come under growing pressure to drop out. She suggested she will stay at least until Tuesday\u2019s primary.</p>", "<p>\u201cSome folks say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to end this before you get to West Virginia,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI think we want to keep this going so the people of West Virginia\u2019s voices are heard.\u201d</p>", "<p>After a stop in Sioux Falls, S.D., Clinton concluded her day Thursday night with a town-hall event in Central Point, Ore.</p>", "<p>Sen. Barack Obama, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill, where even Republican lawmakers elbowed past colleagues in the House chamber to shake his hand.</p>", "<p>On NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News with Brian Williams,\u201d Obama denied he is now the presumptive nominee. \u201cNot yet. I will be,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Senator Clinton decides not to go on, or if we complete the six contests and we are ahead as we are now. But nothing is certain. I don\u2019t want to take it for granted.\u201d</p>", "<p>Having invested 16 months and raised more than $200 million, Clinton might find it difficult to quit. Her campaign persona is solidly built on the idea that she\u2019s working-class America\u2019s scrappy warrior. So dropping out with six contests left would be awkward.</p>", "<p>And people who have spoken to her say she is reluctant to leave.</p>", "<p>Rep. Tim Mahoney, D-Fla., met privately with Clinton on Wednesday. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t talking exit. She\u2019s talking winning,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>Chris Lehane, who served in President Clinton\u2019s administration, said: \u201cHaving worked for them I would never, ever count out a Clinton: Bill, Hillary, Chelsea or the cat Socks. One of the primary reasons she has remained extremely competitive in this race is that people have extrapolated she\u2019s a fighter.\u201d</p>", "<p>But even trusted aides don\u2019t see how she can wrest the nomination from Obama.</p>", "<p>They are divided over what course she should follow. Some believe she should not drop out until the last contests June 3. Others contend she should exit \u201cgracefully\u201d soon.</p>", "<p>Addressing concern among some Democrats that Clinton would fight on to the national convention in August, campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe suggested that the race would end quickly after the final primaries, sparing the party a potentially debilitating summerlong battle.</p>", "<p>\u201cAfter June 3, this is going to come to a conclusion,\u201d McAuliffe said Thursday morning on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program.</p>", "<p>Ultimately, an aide said, Clinton will decide what to do in concert with her husband; staff won\u2019t be consulted on so momentous a decision.</p>", "<p>Some members of Clinton\u2019s circle are thinking through conditions under which she might concede the race.</p>", "<p>One Clinton supporter familiar with the campaign\u2019s operations said she wants to go out on a positive note \u2014 say, after winning in West Virginia and Kentucky, whose primaries are Tuesday and May 20, respectively.</p>", "<p>She also would want a resolution to the disputed elections in Florida and Michigan, the campaign supporter said. That would enable her to say she worked successfully to give those voters a voice.</p>", "<p>The Democratic Party nullified the outcomes in Florida and Michigan as punishment for their leapfrogging other states on the election calendar. Clinton won both elections, but neither candidate officially campaigned in the states, and Obama\u2019s name wasn\u2019t on the Michigan ballot.</p>", "<p>On Thursday, Clinton sent Obama a letter asking him to help her ensure that Florida and Michigan voters \u201chave a voice in selecting our party\u2019s nominee.\u201d</p>", "<p>The dispute could be resolved as early as May 31 by the Democratic National Committee\u2019s rules panel, which has the authority to reinstate the delegations or fashion a compromise.</p>", "<p>Given Obama\u2019s formidable lead in delegates, he could agree to seat the entire delegations from both states and still maintain his advantage over Clinton.</p>", "<p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve resolved Michigan and Florida and she wins a couple of more states \u2014 West Virginia and Kentucky \u2014 and she still can\u2019t get the nomination barring an act of God, I don\u2019t think she stays in the race,\u201d the Clinton supporter said.</p>", "<p>Although she is campaigning, Clinton is avoiding direct attacks on Obama, choosing a more muted approach.</p>", "<p>In South Dakota on Thursday, she didn\u2019t mention his name. Instead, she spooled out her policy positions and spoke glowingly about the achievements of her husband\u2019s White House.</p>", "<p><em>The New York Times and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Clinton advisers talk exit strategy      "]}

Obama advisers think that, as the most viable African-American candidate to seek the presidency, he will go over well with voters in South Carolina, where about half of Democratic primary voters are black.</p>", "<p>Yet Clinton also has strong support in both South Carolina and Nevada, and her victory Tuesday is likely to assure fundraisers and key supporters that she is still highly competitive. She may consider realigning her message, and possibly her campaign organization.</p>", "<p>In the final analysis, the crucial burst of support for Clinton may have less to do with issues and more to do with a major stylistic change she made in the final hours of the campaign.</p>", "<p>After Obama beat Clinton decisively in Iowa, her numbers in New Hampshire began to slide \u2014 bad news in a state she had thought would be her bulwark against Obama.</p>", "<p>As momentum seemed to gather behind Obama, Clinton briefly but obviously choked up while speaking publicly to voters one day before the primary, as she discussed the importance of this election.</p>", "<p>The image of the usually steely Clinton displaying emotions dominated the news in the final hours.</p>", "<p>In the weekend debate, she also said it \u201churt her feelings\u201d that voters repeatedly tell pollsters they find Obama more likable than they find her.</p>", "<p>Clinton\u2019s popularity, which soared notably when she was in a vulnerable position in the White House, may have recovered this week for the same reasons.</p>", "<p>Indeed, women voters were predominant in the Democratic primary, a demographic that likely helped Clinton to her narrow victory.</p>", "<p>Clinton won nearly half the women\u2019s vote while Obama took about one-third \u2014 a switch from Iowa, where women helped put him over the top.</p>", "<p>At the same time, independent voters also played a big role in New Hampshire, which may have accrued to Obama\u2019s benefit. His projected image as untainted and a \u201cchange agent\u201d has appealed to independents, who made up more than four of every 10 voters Tuesday night.</p>", "<p>But that result actually could bode well for Clinton in weeks to come, because independents don\u2019t wield as much influence in some other states.</p>", "<p>Clinton had continued to emphasize her White House experience during the administration of her husband, President Clinton.</p>", "<p>Although she has spent many weeks discussing what she sees as Obama\u2019s thin r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which includes eight years in the Illinois Legislature and two years in the U.S. Senate, Clinton threw that message into overdrive this week.</p>", "<p>That may have taken hold with some primary voters.

Since winning the Iowa caucuses early this month, Obama has struggled to outpace Clinton in two consecutive contests and is banking heavily on a victory next Saturday in South Carolina, a state with a large African-American voting bloc.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe ran an honest, uplifting campaign in Nevada that focused on the real problems Americans are facing, a campaign that appealed to people\u2019s hopes instead of their fears,\u201d Obama said in a statement.</p>", "<p>The Nevada results contained some worrisome signs for Obama along demographic lines. The heavy support for Clinton among Hispanics suggested Obama will face an uphill climb to win that important group in California, New York and New Jersey, the three largest states with races Feb. 5.</p>", "<p>In the first contest where race has played an important role, white caucusgoers in Nevada backed Clinton over Obama, 52 percent to 34 percent; African Americans broke heavily for Obama over Clinton, 83 percent to 14 percent; and nearly two-thirds of Latinos chose Clinton.</p>", "<p>At the same time, Clinton continued to outperform Obama among women, a trend that began with her victory in New Hampshire, reversing Obama\u2019s early victory among women in Iowa.</p>", "<p>According to network entrance polling, women made up 59 percent of all caucusgoers in Nevada, and went into the caucuses favoring Clinton over Obama, 51 percent to 38 percent, similar to the advantage among women she enjoyed in New Hampshire.</p>", "<p>In the two weeks since her stinging third-place defeat in Iowa, Clinton has sharpened her differences with Obama to emphasize experience and the economy.</p>", "<p>Another winner of the Nevada caucus was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who secured the No. 3 spot on the calendar for his state. He also predicted turnout of 100,000 \u2014 more than 10 times the Democratic turnout in the 2004 Nevada caucuses \u2014 a forecast that appeared to come true, with about 114,000 caucusgoers reported.</p>", "<p>Turnout was less impressive along the Strip, where hundreds rather than thousands turned up at nine at-large sites.</p>", "<p>Two factors appeared to sway the outcome on the Strip: a backlash among some workers toward the Culinary Workers Union, and former President Clinton, who spent much of the past week campaigning among casino workers in employee lounges and the like.</p>", "<p>\u201cI really thought [Obama] was going to get more union support,\u201d said Anthony Edwards, who works in customer service at the Bellagio and caucused for the Illinois senator. But when the union started pushing Obama last week, after its endorsement, \u201ca lot of people said, \u2018Whoa, wait a minute.\u2019 And today, at least, they jumped off the union bandwagon.\u201d</p>", "<p>Eddie Hunter, a Bellagio blackjack dealer, looked dejected as she returned to her post, Obama button pinned to her blouse. \u201cHillary is good, too, so I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p>Xiao Jing Gu, a Bellagio housekeeper holding a sign, \u201cI support my union.

She urged the two sides to work together in researching renewable-energy sources, less-polluting technologies and energy efficiency.</p>", "<p>\u201cWhat we hope is that you won\u2019t make the same mistakes we made, because I don\u2019t think either China or the world could afford that,\u201d Clinton said.</p>", "<p>To the apparent relief of China, Clinton downplayed issues of human rights and religious freedom, saying they were raised in her meetings but that the administration of President Obama saw advantage to working with Beijing on areas of greater agreement.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt is essential that the United States and China have a cooperative, positive relationship,\u201d Clinton said at a news conference with Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi.</p>", "<p>Several human-rights groups decried Clinton\u2019s suggestion that human rights would not be a priority in U.S. engagement with China. Amnesty International said it was \u201cshocked and extremely disappointed.\u201d</p>", "<p>Another advocacy group, China Human Rights Defenders, said police confined some dissidents to their homes during Clinton\u2019s weekend visit to Beijing.

But how she navigates a party animated by economic populism, an approach personified by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, could represent one of her biggest hurdles. Democrats bruised from GOP gains in the 2014 elections are pushing for big policy changes \u2014 raising the minimum wage and pay equity, for example \u2014 that favor the declining middle class.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t win when we play small-ball and calibrate.

She showcased this posture during December\u2019s \u201clame duck\u201d session of Congress, when she led the charge against a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill \u2014 ultimately signed by Obama \u2014 that repealed part of the Dodd-Frank financial law and loosened contribution caps for some political donors. Clinton has yet to comment on the spending plan.</p>", "<p>During the fall elections, Clinton often pointed to the broad prosperity during her husband\u2019s administration and advocated for policies to raise the minimum wage, address pay equity for women and provide paid leave for new mothers.</p>", "<p>In a nod to liberals, Clinton has voiced concerns about the concentration of wealth, pointing to the rise in income and wealth to the top 0.01 percent of the population. \u201cSome are calling it a throwback to the \u2018Gilded Age\u2019 of the robber barons,\u201d Clinton said in May.</p>", "<p>Clinton also has stumbled on the economy. At a fall event, she drew criticism from Republicans when she said \u201cdon\u2019t let anybody tell you that it\u2019s corporations and businesses that create jobs.\u201d She quickly cleaned up those comments, arguing that trickle-down economics had failed.</p>", "<p>Her supporters point to her 2008 primary campaign, when she scored wins in Ohio and Pennsylvania, as an indicator of how she could connect with working-class families. They also downplay the differences between her and Warren on the economy.</p>", "<p>\u201cI think the debate is not going to be about big major fundamental directions for the economy. The disagreement will be how to get there,\u201d said former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who has backed Clinton.</p>", "<p>Clinton could have more opportunities to connect with \u2014 or alienate \u2014 liberals in 2015.</p>", "<p>One moment could come on the nomination of Lazard investment banker Antonio Weiss to lead a Treasury Department office overseeing domestic finance. Weiss, Warren contends, would represent a long line of Wall Street executives who are part of the revolving door between Washington and the financial markets.</p>", "<p>Clinton has not yet spoken publicly about Weiss\u2019 nomination.</p>", "<p>She remains a favorite of Wall Street from her time representing New York in the Senate. At a recent conference sponsored by the New York Times\u2019 DealBook, Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein said he had \u201calways been a fan of Hillary Clinton\u201d and argued it was important for political leaders to have relationships with key institutions. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s a virtue to declare a big segment of the economy off limits,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>Promoting economic growth and wages will also be on the calendar. The AFL-CIO has invited Warren to deliver the keynote address at its national summit on wages in early January, giving her a plum appearance before labor leaders.</p>", "<p>About a week later, the Center for American Progress, which was founded by ex-Clinton administration officials, will release a report offering ways to spur middle-class growth, ideas that might guide Clinton\u2019s agenda. The panel is co-chaired by Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton.</p>", "<p>Tad Devine, an adviser to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is considering a 2016 presidential campaign, noted that Bill Clinton campaigned in 1992 as a different kind of Democrat willing to reform welfare and appeal to centrists. This time, he said, Hillary Clinton will need to make a decision of how she will position herself on the economy.</p>", "<p>\u201cThere is a huge audience right now for people who want to have a completely different economic theory of what\u2019s wrong with the country and how to fix it,\u201d Devine said.</p>", "<p>___</p>", "<p>Follow Ken Thomas on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KThomasDC</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Clinton economic approach under scrutiny      "]}

She doesn\u2019t seem to know how to stop it or want to stop it.\u201d</p>", "<p>Over the last month, Clinton, of New York, has become much more involved in the day-to-day operation of her campaign. In addition to Williams, she brought in two experienced political hands from her husband\u2019s White House \u2014 Doug Sosnik, who was a political director, and Steve Ricchetti, a deputy chief of staff.</p>", "<p>And Williams has sought to calm tensions in the headquarters through steps like opening the morning conference call to more aides to foster a greater sense of teamwork. One of her first acts, aides said, was to instruct Mark Penn \u2014 Clinton\u2019s chief strategist, a polarizing figure in the campaign \u2014 to stay off television.</p>", "<p>Still, interviews with campaign aides, associates and friends suggest Clinton, at least until February, was a detached manager.</p>", "<p>Juggling the demands of being a candidate, she paid little attention to detail, delegated decisions and deferred to advisers on critical questions. Clinton accepted \u2014 or seemed unaware of \u2014 the intense factionalism and feuding that often paralyzed her campaign.</p>", "<p>She showed a tendency toward an insular management style, relying on a coterie of aides who have worked for her for years, her aides and associates said. Her choice of lieutenants \u2014 and her insistence on staying with them even when friends urged her to shake things up \u2014 was blamed by some associates for the campaign\u2019s woes. Again and again, the senator was portrayed as a manager who valued loyalty and familiarity over experience and expertise.</p>", "<p>Clinton stood by Penn and Patti Solis Doyle, who was until last month her campaign manager, even as her campaign was at risk of letting Obama sew up the nomination.</p>", "<p>When Clinton finally pushed out Solis Doyle, she chose Williams \u2014 like Solis Doyle, an old friend who had never before managed a presidential campaign.</p>", "<p>Clinton\u2019s ability to manage the one person with whom she spoke most often, former President Clinton, was also questioned.</p>", "<p>Bill Clinton moved in his own orbit \u2014 he heatedly argued with his wife\u2019s advisers who wanted to write off South Carolina, defying them to campaign there \u2014 and took no direction from the campaign about what to say or where to go, some of them said. (Obama defeated Clinton in the South Carolina Democratic primary by nearly 29 percentage points.)</p>", "<p>A senior adviser, Harold Ickes, joined the campaign full time in January as Clinton\u2019s aides began to realize that the contest was not going as planned. Ickes cautioned about drawing firm conclusions about her from this period, when she faced the demands of being a candidate.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to draw conclusions about her management style,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause she is, in fact, not the manager of her campaign.\u201d</p>", "<p>For all her years on the public stage, Clinton has never come close to assembling and running an enterprise like the 700-person, $170 million-and-counting campaign organization that she has created. At times, her aides made assumptions about tactics and voters that turned out to be wrong. They nearly ran out of money at all the wrong times, like just after Clinton\u2019s victory in the New Hampshire primary and right before the 22 state nominating contests on Feb. 5.</p>", "<p>Unlike Bush, Clinton has shown no interest in having one strong person running all aspects of the campaign operation. And unlike her husband during the early part of his 1992 bid for the presidency, she does not try to keep a hand in everything, with lines of communications all through the campaign.</p>", "<p>This approach, many of her associates said, had the effect of breeding resentment at campaign headquarters. Since there was no one person in charge, they said, it was hard to make decisions, and Penn would frequently use his personal connection with Clinton to block the campaign from moving in directions he opposed.</p>", "<p>Penn has been at the center of much of this turmoil.</p>", "<p>Penn and Ickes held a level of disdain for each other that helped poison what was already a toxic atmosphere in the Clinton headquarters, advisers said. Shouting matches between senior advisers became routine, sometimes behind closed doors and sometimes not.</p>", "<p>Aides fought over Penn\u2019s strategy of presenting Clinton as a strong commander in chief rather than trying to humanize her, as aides such as admaker Mandy Grunwald and chief spokesman Howard Wolfson wanted to do. They fought over deployment of assets and dwindling resources, pointing fingers over the failure to field organizations in many states. They fought over how to handle former President Clinton and his habit of drifting away from his talking points.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou just lost the campaign for us,\u201d Clinton\u2019s media adviser, Grunwald, shouted at Penn after the campaign came under fire for running a radio advertisement in South Carolina that made the questionable claim that Obama was a proponent of Republican ideas.

Clinton\u2019s surprise victory in the primary was ascribed, in small part, to women angry that the media seemed to write her off after losing in Iowa.</p>", "<p>On the program, Matthews said: \u201cLet\u2019s not forget, and I\u2019ll be brutal, the reason she\u2019s a U.S. senator, the reason she\u2019s a candidate for president, the reason she may be a front-runner, is that her husband messed around.\u201d</p>", "<p><strong>Huckabee: State flag is state\u2019s business</strong></p>", "<p>MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. \u2014 Republican Mike Huckabee said the government should stay out of disputes over the Confederate flag in South Carolina.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like people from outside the state coming in and telling you what to do with your flag,\u201d Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, said Thursday in Myrtle Beach.</p>", "<p>\u201cIn fact, if somebody came to Arkansas and told us what to do with our flag, we\u2019d tell \u2019em what to do with the pole,\u201d Huckabee said.</p>", "<p>Arkansas\u2019 flag includes four stars surrounding the word \u201cArkansas,\u201d one above it and three below it. The one above stands for the Confederacy, according to the state code.</p>", "<p>Huckabee would not say whether he considers it offensive to fly the flag, a symbol of racism to some and Southern pride to others, saying only that the matter should be up to the states. That was the position of his rival John McCain when he ran for president in 2000; after losing, McCain said he had not been honest about his feelings and that the flag should go.</p>", "<p>Pressed later on whether he finds the flag offensive, Huckabee refused to give an opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s really not something that is an issue for the president of the United States; that\u2019s an issue South Carolina would deal with,\u201d Huckabee said.</p>", "<p><strong>Romney assails use of lobbyists</strong></p>", "<p>COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Republican Mitt Romney said he could govern in the country\u2019s best interest because \u201cI don\u2019t have lobbyists running my campaign,\u201d although Washington, D.C., insiders are on his senior staff and registered lobbyists are top advisers.</p>", "<p>One of them, Ron Kaufman, chairman of the Dutko Group, regularly sits across the aisle from Romney on his campaign plane and participates in debate-strategy sessions.</p>", "<p>Another adviser, former Rep.

Rahm Emanuel considers Sen. Barack Obama a close friend. The Illinois Democrats had dinner last week. They are both from Chicago and socialize together with their wives. But Emanuel got his big break in national politics from Bill Clinton. And now his worst-case scenario has come true: Both Obama and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton are running for president and want his support.</p>", "<p>Emanuel was widely credited with engineering his party\u2019s takeover of the House in November. Fellow White House veterans now are pressing him to take a senior position in the former first lady\u2019s campaign. Meanwhile, Chicago allies, led by the powerful Daley family, are pressing him to take a senior position in his Illinois colleague\u2019s campaign.</p>", "<p>Torn by conflicting loyalties, Emanuel is ducking. \u201cMaybe the witness-protection program,\u201d he joked. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll just stop answering the phone.\u201d</p>", "<p>They still have Iowa and New Hampshire to conquer, but Clinton, Obama and the other Democratic presidential contenders already are squaring off in what might be called the Rahm Primary, an early contest to win over the movers and shakers, such as the Illinois congressman, who launched and ran the only Democratic administration in the past quarter-century. As Clinton kicks off a bid to follow in her husband\u2019s footsteps to the White House, she is trying to reconstitute much of her husband\u2019s old team.</p>", "<p>While it might seem like a simple loyalty test, loyalty in politics is not always defined in terms of who hired someone first or whom someone worked for longest. Politics breeds complicated relationships.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt creates a dilemma for a lot of people,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary now at the Glover Park Group, a communications and lobbying firm with close ties to Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt would be easy if you had worked for a person who you knew wasn\u2019t up to the job, but that\u2019s not the case this year. It takes a little soul-searching on what you want to do.\u201d</p>", "<p>Many familiar figures from the 1990s, such as Lockhart, are back in the Clinton corner formally or informally \u2014 political advisers, fundraisers and policy aides such as James Carville, Harold Ickes, Mark Penn, Mandy Grunwald, Ann Lewis, Maggie Williams, Bruce Reed, John Podesta, Patti Solis Doyle and Terry McAuliffe.</p>", "<p>But others are signing up with Obama or other candidates or staying on the sidelines, out of estrangement from the Clintons, skepticism about her chances, fealty to other patrons or some combination.</p>", "<p>Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, widely considered his party\u2019s economic wise man, has refused to sign up with Clinton or another candidate. So has House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who recruited Clinton to run for the Senate from New York in 2000 but who lately has encouraged Obama to run for president.</p>", "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who the rest of the candidates are,\u201d Rangel said with a wry arch of an eyebrow last week when asked whether he would prefer Obama or Clinton.</p>", "<p>\u201cMost Democratic political professionals over the age of 25 who came to Washington passed through the Clinton administration at some point \u2026 \u201d said Reed, Bill Clinton\u2019s domestic policy adviser and now president of the Democratic Leadership Council. \u201cIt would be hard to fill a campaign without some people who had the \u201990s on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\u201d</p>", "<p>For some, the choice was not that hard. \u201cThe Clintons, for me and for many of us who worked for him, we owe them our loyalty,\u201d said Steve Ricchetti, who was deputy White House chief of staff. \u201cThey have been very generous personally and gave me my biggest opportunities in public service. It\u2019s not something you forget.\u201d</p>", "<p>Yet others have not forgotten the personal slights, policy struggles and turf battles; the Clinton White House was left with its share of scar tissue. Hillary Clinton inspired deep affection and loyalty among her staff, but she could be demanding, and her temper sometimes singed those outside her inner circle.</p>", "<p>For that matter, her husband could be tough to work for as well. Some who served in the West Wing emerged bruised by the experience, disenchanted with the conduct that led to his impeachment and leery of returning for Clinton the Sequel.</p>", "<p>They do not couch their decisions this year in those terms, though, at least not publicly. They explain their neutrality or affiliations by the complex rules of political allegiance \u2014 an old boss who came calling, a new job that prevents partisan activity, more recent involvement with another candidate, the sorts of word-of-mouth encounters that can bring teams together by happenstance more than by design.</p>", "<p>Others calculated that another candidate would be more likely to win or would be a better president than Clinton. Lake said he was impressed with Obama. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been excited by somebody since 1992, when I was doing foreign policy with Bill Clinton,\u201d he said. As for Hillary Clinton, he said: \u201cI think highly of her. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to help somebody run against her. I\u2019m helping somebody I think can be a great president.\u201d</p>", "<p>Under other circumstances, Emanuel would be a natural for the Obama camp. But Emanuel was a rambunctious 31-year-old when he joined Clinton\u2019s campaign in 1991 as one of the original members of the Little Rock war room and followed the candidate to the White House. Although he was demoted at one point \u2014 reportedly at the instigation of the first lady \u2014 he eventually became one of the president\u2019s closest aides.</p>", "<p>Emanuel declared on TV early last year that he was supporting Clinton, but that was before Obama expressed interest in running. The congressman now is officially neutral. And both sides are lobbying him to take a top campaign post.</p>", "<p>\u201cI have two friends in this,\u201d Emanuel said.</p>", "<p>As for picking sides, he said: \u201cThere will be an appropriate time.

The final figures \u201chave been double and triple checked,\u201d he said in a televised announcement.</p>", "<p>New Mexico Democrats call their contest a caucus, but it\u2019s not like Iowa\u2019s caucuses where voters gather in gyms, churches or meeting rooms, divide into groups for each candidate, try to attract more support from other groups, and then count each group. Rather it more closely resembles a \u201cfirehall primary\u201d _ a primary with shorter voting hours and fewer voting sites than would be found in traditional state primaries.</p>", "<p>It was a mess: Overwhelmed polling places with long lines, some up to three hours. Too few ballots. Confusion over where to vote. Bad weather in the north.

Bill Richardson, a former presidential hopeful who said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the problems.

On Thursday, six days after the Paris attacks, she gave a comprehensive anti-terrorism speech at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>", "<p>The speech was very impressive. While other candidates are content to issue vague calls to get tough on terror, Clinton offered a multilayered but coherent framework, not only dealing with ISIS but also putting that threat within the crosscutting conflicts that are inflaming the Middle East.</p>", "<p>For example, instead of just issuing a generic call to get tough on the terrorists, she pointed to the reality that ISIS will be toppled only if there is an uprising by fellow Sunnis. There has to be a Sunni Awakening against ISIS in 2016, like the Sunni Awakening that toppled al-Qaida in Iraq starting in 2007.</p>", "<p>That will not happen while President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria is spreading mayhem, terror and genocide. As long as they find themselves in the grips of a horrific civil war, even sensible Sunnis will feel that they need ISIS as a counterpoint to the butchery coming out of Damascus.</p>", "<p>Clinton therefore gestured to the reality that you can\u2019t really deal with ISIS unless you are also willing to deal with Assad. Assad is not some secondary threat who we can deal with after we\u2019ve tamed the ISIS monster. Assad created the failed state and the power vacuum that ISIS was able to fill. Assad serves as chief recruiter for ISIS every time he drops a barrel bomb on a school or a market. Assad, as Clinton pointed out, has killed even more Syrians than ISIS has.</p>", "<p>Dealing with both Assad and ISIS simultaneously throws you into the bitter and complex jockeying between Sunni and Shiite, between Iran and Saudi Arabia. It puts pressure on your Ukraine policy (Vladimir Putin will want concessions as a price for backing off his aggression in the Middle East). Everything is connected. Which is why the presidency is for grown-ups, not rank outsiders.</p>", "<p>Some of Clinton\u2019s specific prescriptions were a little too limited and Obamaesque for my taste (she didn\u2019t even call for more American Special Operations forces to improve the bombing campaigns, though she said she would be open to it). But she is thoughtful and instructive on both the big picture and the right way forward. She seems to understand that if we end up allying with Russia in a common fight against terrorism, we will end up preserving Assad, preserving ISIS and making everything worse.</p>", "<p>Some Republicans have stained themselves with refugee xenophobia, but there\u2019s a bigger story here: For a time, the Middle East was held together by Arab nation-states and a belief in Arab nationalisms. Recently Arab nationalisms have withered and Arab nation-states have begun to dissolve from their own decrepitude.</p>", "<p>Along comes ISIS filling that vacuum and trying to destroy what\u2019s left of Arab nations. ISIS dreams of a caliphate. It erases borders. It destroys order.</p>", "<p>The Arab nation-states were not great. But the nation-state system did preserve a certain order. National identities and boundaries enabled Sunnis and Shiites to live together peaceably. If nations go away in the region we\u2019ll get a sectarian war of all against all, radiating terrorism like we\u2019ve never seen.</p>", "<p>The grand strategy of American policy in the Middle East, therefore, should be to do what we can to revive and reform Arab nations, to help them become functioning governing units.</p>", "<p>That means confronting the forces that thrive in failed states. That begins with stepped-up military pressure on ISIS. Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations proposes a campaign like the one that allowed the Northern Alliance to overthrow the Taliban after 9/11 \u2014 a light footprint campaign using Special Operations forces and C.I.A. paramilitaries to direct allied bombing in support of locals on the ground. Once life becomes a miserable grind for ISIS soldiers, recruiting will suffer.</p>", "<p>But it also means going hard on Assad, creating no-fly zones for sanctuaries for Syrian refugees to limit his power, ratcheting up pressure on Iran and Russia to force his departure. And it also means supporting institutional reform, as Clinton said, throughout the Arab world, to revitalize nations as functioning units. Not an unsustainable stab at nation-building, but better governance from top to bottom.</p>", "<p>Before Paris it was possible to argue that time was on our side, that we could sit back and let ISIS collapse under the weight of its own craziness. The Paris attacks refuted that. ISIS is becoming an ever more aggressive threat. The F.B.I. already has over 900 active Islamic State investigations ongoing. Lord knows what sort of biological or other weapons the group can get its hands on.</p>", "<p>Candidate Clinton laid out a supple and sophisticated approach.

We\u2019ve broken the tie, and thanks to you, it\u2019s full speed on to the White House,\u201d Clinton told hundreds of supporters in downtown Indianapolis. Former President Clinton and daughter Chelsea were by her side.</p>", "<p>Underscoring the difficulty of her effort to block Obama from claiming the Democratic nomination, Clinton also made a direct fundraising appeal to backers to help her compete against his better-financed operation.</p>", "<p>\u201cI need your help to continue our journey,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis has always been your campaign, and this is your victory because your support has meant the difference between winning and losing.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cI hope you will go to <a href=\"http://hillaryclinton.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"content-link external\">HillaryClinton.com</a> and support our campaign,\u201d she added.</p>", "<p>Clinton spoke before it was certain that she had won Indiana. Clinton led narrowly in the state, and Obama said it appeared Clinton had won there. But thousands of votes had yet to be counted, principally in Lake County, a heavily black area not far from Obama\u2019s home city of Chicago.</p>", "<p>Clinton noted the back-and-forth nature of the protracted fight: \u201cI win, he wins. I win, he wins. It\u2019s so close.\u201d</p>", "<p>Then, in what was perhaps a nod to her uphill struggle to overcome Obama\u2019s delegate lead, she pledged anew that she\u2019ll swing behind the Democratic nominee \u201cno matter what happens.\u201d</p>", "<p>She pledged to press on for the nomination, saying: \u201cThese next primaries are another test. I will work my heart out in West Virginia and Kentucky. I intend to win them in November.\u201d</p>", "<p>Clinton hoped an Indiana victory would give her fresh talking points as she works to convince voters yet to cast their ballots and undecided superdelegates \u2014 elected Democratic officials \u2014 to side with her in the punishingly long nomination fight.</p>", "<p>The New York senator was heading back to Washington late Tuesday. Her only public appearance Wednesday was an evening fundraiser. She planned to return to the campaign trail Thursday with events in at least one of the remaining states to vote.</p>", "<p>Once the Democratic front-runner, Clinton sustained a series of losses to Obama early in the year and in the months since has been slowly clawing her way back into the thick of the race.</p>", "<p>Over the past two months, she scored a couple of big-state wins as Obama faltered amid the controversy surrounding his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, and Obama\u2019s own comment that people from small towns cling to guns and religion because they are bitter.</p>", "<p>Seeking to take advantage of that opportunity, Clinton retooled her campaign to focus on producing results for an anxious middle class and started aggressively courting white, working-class voters at a time of economic anxiety. With that strategy, she triumphed last month in Pennsylvania and kept her candidacy alive.</p>", "<p>She used the same bread-and-butter message in Indiana and North Carolina, and the final days of those primaries were dominated by Clinton\u2019s call for a summertime suspension of the federal gasoline tax.</p>", "<p>Despite her progress, the math in the race to rack up the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the nomination still favors Obama; he leads Clinton in delegates won in primaries and caucuses, and has steadily whittled away at Clinton\u2019s advantage in superdelegates over the past two weeks.</p>", "<p>It will be difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 for Clinton to overtake him even if she manages to win a chunk of the states left to vote and convinces many of the unaligned superdelegate to break her way.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Clinton declares victory in Indiana      "]}

During one famous 48-hour period, she met with Palestinian officials in Abu Dhabi, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and, after doing an all-nighter in Morocco, a group of Arab leaders.</p>", "<p>Of course, she got sick. Who wouldn\u2019t? Lots of otherwise healthy Americans come down with a nasty bug after just one transatlantic fight to London. Add to that constant time-zone changes, rich banquets, minimal exercise, lack of sleep and stress-filled meetings. Clinton wasn\u2019t there to stroll around museums.</p>", "<p>What\u2019s not cute about all this is the underlying \u2014 shall we say? \u2014 irresponsibility of so overstuffing the agenda. This blows against Clinton\u2019s reputation as the ultimate Responsible One. It\u2019s thus disturbing that many of her admirers portrayed the resulting sickness as a tribute to her work ethic.</p>", "<p>Melanne Verveer, a longtime Clinton aide now at the State Department, meant only praise when she said of the secretary of state: \u201cSo many people who know her have urged me to tell her not to work so hard. Well, that\u2019s not easy to do when you\u2019re Hillary Clinton. She doesn\u2019t spare herself.\u201d</p>", "<p>Yes, she works hard, but doesn\u2019t working smart mean pacing oneself so that you don\u2019t fall apart in the last mile of the marathon? People do get ill through no fault of their own, but Clinton was asking for it.</p>", "<p>All that racing around Mideast capitals sometimes took on the air of a personal endurance test rather than effective management of foreign policy. (You\u2019ll note that the Arab-Israeli conflict remains unresolved.)</p>", "<p>Make no mistake: Clinton has been a fine secretary of state. Few would argue otherwise. Still, we\u2019re kind of lucky there wasn\u2019t a major new international crisis in December.</p>", "<p>It pains me to bring up the woman angle here, but you wonder whether a man would have overscheduled to the point of collapse. (Only one secretary of state exceeded Clinton in the number of miles traveled: Condoleezza Rice.) President Obama tries to make time for exercise and rest, as did President George W. Bush before him. They understand the importance of maintaining their health.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s no small irony that Clinton\u2019s recent illness has led some Democrats eager for a strong female presidential candidate in 2016 to start looking beyond Hillary. It may be true that Clinton says she\u2019s not interested in running again, but her medical scare is making some supporters think she means it.</p>", "<p>The let\u2019s-find-a-woman people are misguided. I don\u2019t believe in backing candidates on the basis of gender (or race, religion, height or eye color). Hillary Clinton became one of our era\u2019s great political figures for other reasons.</p>", "<p>While she will never embody the cool and outward serenity of Barack Obama, Clinton didn\u2019t have to become the spinning top that put her in a sick bed. Even there, she noted \u2014 not without pride \u2014 her difficulty in becoming a \u201ccompliant patient.\u201d If Clinton does run for president, she must show more dedication to self-preservation. Martyrs don\u2019t necessarily make great managers.</p>", "<p><em>\u00a9 , The Providence Journal Co.</em></p>", "<p><em>Froma Harrop\u2019s column appears regularly on editorial pages of The Times.

Hillary Rodham Clinton has officially recognized the multimillion-dollar toll the campaign took on her personal assets.</p>", "<p>Clinton filed papers with the Federal Election Commission over the weekend formally writing off all of the $13.2 million she lent the campaign, plus $77,900 in interest on the loan.</p>", "<p>Clinton was able to write off the loan because she and her husband, former President Clinton, have amassed significant wealth since leaving the White House. The couple have reported earnings of $109 million during the period, mostly from Bill Clinton\u2019s speeches.</p>", "<p>Her giving up any hope of reclaiming the money, a step signaled in September when the statutory deadline passed for recouping all but a small piece of it, confirms the financial strain the fundraising juggernaut of the Obama campaign placed on Clinton personally.</p>", "<p>And in addition to the personal loan, the same weekend filing showed she still owed millions to dozens of vendors as of Nov. 30. She did manage to chip away at that debt in November, reducing by roughly $1.1 million the $7.5 million she owed at the end of October. The single biggest debt as of November\u2019s end was $5.4 million, to the firm of Mark Penn, her former chief strategist.</p>", "<p>The shadow of her debt has hung over Clinton ever since she ended her campaign for the nomination in June. The Clintons have held a series of fundraisers to try to pay it off, and President-elect Obama has been urging his supporters to help out.</p>", "<p>Clinton even recruited her mother, Dorothy Rodham, to the cause. In early December, Rodham sent an e-mail message to supporters urging contributions to help retire her daughter\u2019s campaign debt and offering an autographed children\u2019s book about Clinton in exchange for a donation of $250 or more.</p>", "<p>Now, nominated to be secretary of state, Clinton has been dealing with additional finance-related complications. Her husband already has disclosed a long list of donors to his charitable organizations, making his international dealings more transparent and thus meeting a condition Obama set for his selection of Clinton.</p>", "<p>And Congress has removed another stumbling block by adopting a measure to reduce the secretary of state\u2019s salary, satisfying an obscure constitutional provision that forbids appointment of a lawmaker to a federal position that was either created or given a pay increase during the legislator\u2019s concurrent term.</p>", "<p>But if Clinton is confirmed as secretary, her ability to raise money to pay off her campaign debt will be sharply restricted.

Hillary Rodham Clinton defended staying in the Democratic nominating contest Friday by pointing out that her husband did not wrap up the nomination until June 1992 and that \u201cWe all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.\u201d</p>", "<p>Her remarks were met with quick criticism from the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois. Within hours of making them, Clinton, of New York, expressed regret, saying, \u201cThe Kennedys have been much on my mind the last days because of Sen. Kennedy,\u201d referring to the recent diagnosis of Sen. Edward Kennedy\u2019s brain tumor.</p>", "<p>She added, \u201cAnd I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation and particularly for the Kennedy family was in any way offensive.\u201d</p>", "<p>Still, the comments touched on one of the most sensitive aspects of the current presidential campaign: concern for Obama\u2019s safety. And they come as Democrats have been talking increasingly of an Obama-Clinton ticket, with even Bill Clinton musing with associates about the possibility that running as vice president might be his wife\u2019s best path to the presidency if she loses the nomination fight.</p>", "<p>It was in the context of discussions about her political future that Clinton made the remarks Friday, in a meeting with the editorial board of The Sioux Falls (S.D.) Argus Leader. She had said some people whom she did not name were trying to push her out of the race, but she noted that many races have gone on longer than hers.</p>", "<p>\u201cMy husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June, right? We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California. I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Clinton said, dismissing the idea of dropping out.</p>", "<p>Bill Burton, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said her statement \u201cwas unfortunate and has no place in this campaign.\u201d</p>", "<p>Concerns about Obama\u2019s safety led the Secret Service to give him protection last May, before it was given any other presidential candidate, although Clinton had protection in her capacity as former first lady. His wife, Michelle, voiced concerns about his safety before he was elected to the Senate, and black voters have said such fears weighed on their decision about whether to vote for him.</p>", "<p>It was against that backdrop that Clinton\u2019s mentioning the 1968 Kennedy assassination in the same breath as her own political fate struck some as reckless. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, an uncommitted superdelegate and the House Democratic whip, through a spokeswoman, called them \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d</p>", "<p>The remarks and resulting reaction illustrated the new tableaux candidates are coping with in this year\u2019s campaign, where Obama\u2019s remarks about \u201cbitter\u201d small-town voters ricocheted around the Internet and hobbled his campaign before the Pennsylvania primary.</p>", "<p>During the editorial-board meeting Friday, Clinton also denied reports of any contact with the Obama camp regarding an exit strategy for her, or discussions about becoming Obama\u2019s running mate.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s flatly, completely untrue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything I\u2019m entertaining, nothing I have planned, nothing I\u2019m prepared to engaged in.\u201d</p>", "<p>Friday\u2019s remarks were not the first time Clinton alluded to Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s slaying in such a context. She did so in a March interview with Time magazine, saying: \u201cPrimary contests used to last a lot longer. We all remember the great tragedy of Bobby Kennedy being assassinated in June in L.A.\u201d</p>", "<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has endorsed Clinton, defended her remarks in a telephone interview Friday evening.</p>", "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard her make that argument before,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIt sounds like she was invoking a familiar historical circumstance in support of her argument for continuing her campaign.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Clinton remarks create new flap      "]}

But it\u2019s probably smaller than the chance that a continued slugfest will hand the White House to John McCain.</p>", "<p>Consider what it would take for Clinton to win:</p>", "<p>For starters, she would have to pull ahead in the popular vote, to balance her second-place spot in number of states won and in pledged delegates. As Bill Clinton put it on March 17: \u201cIf Senator Obama wins the popular vote, then the choice will be easier. But if Hillary wins the popular vote but can\u2019t quite catch up with the delegate votes, then you have to just ask yourself which is more important and who is more likely to win in November.\u201d</p>", "<p>Even Bill Clinton seemed to concede the nomination to Obama unless his wife wins the popular vote; without that, she doesn\u2019t even have an argument. Unfortunately for the Clintons, almost nobody who has done the math thinks that she can win the popular vote without revotes in Florida and Michigan.</p>", "<p>Clinton is more than 700,000 votes behind in the popular vote. With 10 states and territories still to vote, perhaps another 6 million votes could be cast if turnout is very high, by the count of Ben Smith at <a href=\"http://politico.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"content-link external\">Politico.com</a>.</p>", "<p>To get the lead, she would need to win at least 56 percent of all remaining votes \u2014 or well more than 60 percent of the votes outside of North Carolina and other states she is expected to lose. So far, though, Clinton hasn\u2019t won 60 percent in any state except Arkansas, where she had been the state\u2019s first lady.</p>", "<p>All this means that Clinton\u2019s chances of winning are negligible, barring some major development.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, the big winner of the Democratic fist-fighting is McCain. A Gallup Poll released Wednesday found that 19 percent of Obama\u2019s supporters said they would vote for McCain in the general election if Clinton were the nominee. More startling, 28 percent of Clinton\u2019s supporters said they would defect to McCain if Obama were the nominee.</p>", "<p>Exit polls show the same trend. In South Carolina in January, about 70 percent of each candidate\u2019s supporters said they would be happy if the other person ended up winning the nomination. By the Ohio and Texas primaries in March, fewer than half of each candidate\u2019s supporters said they would be content with the other person as nominee.</p>", "<p>Granted, tempers may cool by November. But dragging out the contest only deepens wounds and reduces time for healing: In nine of the last 10 presidential elections, the nominee chosen first ended up winning in November.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how bitter it\u2019s getting, and it can only get worse in the months ahead,\u201d said Gov. Philip Bredesen, D-Tenn., who has not taken sides. \u201cI\u2019d love to have a Democratic president, but I\u2019d also love to have a Democratic Congress. If you\u2019ve got people mad and staying home, that can\u2019t possibly help candidates running for the Senate, candidates running for House seats, and for the state Legislature.\u201d</p>", "<p>Bredesen is urging superdelegates (he is one) to hold a primary in June, so that a winner would be chosen in time to begin a healing process before the convention.</p>", "<p>Instead, the battle is getting bloodier. Clinton spoke this week about the contest continuing for \u201cthe next three months\u201d \u2014 and those would surely be a toxic three months. There\u2019s already grumbling that Clinton\u2019s real strategy is to destroy Obama\u2019s chances of winning the general election so that she can compete in 2012.</p>", "<p>Hillary Clinton, who has done so much fine work on health and children\u2019s issues for so many years and who more recently has been an outstanding senator, deserves better. Likewise, Bill Clinton, who tackled AIDS and poverty so passionately since leaving the White House, risks tarnishing his own legacy.</p>", "<p>If Clinton can run a high-minded, civil campaign and rein in her proxies, then she has every right to continue through the next few primaries, and the Democrats might even benefit from the bolstered attention and turnout. But if the brawl continues, then she and her husband may be remembered by people who long admired them as having the same effect on Obama this November that Ralph Nader had on Al Gore in 2000.</p>", "<p>Do the Clintons really want to risk becoming the Naders of 2008?</p>", "<p><em>Nicholas D.

She plans to campaign in Miami Tuesday, as part of a two -day tour through battleground Florida, home of 29 electoral votes.</p>", "<p>Clinton is focusing on jobs and the economy at campaign events.

Bundlers have become especially important since recent campaign finance-reform laws limited the amount a single individual can contribute to political causes.</p>", "<p>Nearly all major presidential campaigns rely on bundlers, and most do the same minimal background checks that the Clinton campaign had done.

It\u2019s going to be nasty. And we, dear voters, are caught in the middle.</p>", "<p>On the left is seriously smart Hillary Clinton, who has punched her ticket so thoroughly that no other heavyweight Democrat has yet emerged to take her on for the nomination battle. But time after time, she displays a disdainful arrogance that smacks of entitlement. The private Hillary is as warm and charming a woman as anyone could conjure up. The public Hillary sometimes seems brittle, with the judgment of a raging rhinoceros.</p>", "<p>On the right are the usual suspects, the Hillary haters and political social climbers who see a smackdown with her as the ultimate badge of having arrived. No matter what she does, no matter what she says, some people will always dislike her, never trust her and wouldn\u2019t dream of voting for her.</p>", "<p>The real question remains: Why is she running? She had a chance to make a difference in the world as secretary of state but it\u2019s hard to see that the world is a better place.

Jousting with domestic economic inequality, fighting racial injustice, advocating rights for women, tighter relations with allies, restoring the middle class, refusing to let terrorists win: The list is predictable \u2014 and daunting.</p>", "<p>Just as Obama was stymied repeatedly by an unruly Republican-dominated Congress that couldn\u2019t get its act together, so Hillary would face the same challenge. Any budget proposal, major legislative initiative, trade deal, treaty she sent to Capitol Hill would be dead on arrival. The White House as fishbowl is a perfect metaphor; her every action, reaction or non-action would be scathingly denounced by her often pathetically predictable enemies. Plus all eyes would be on the ex-president again.</p>", "<p>Of course, we have not heard a visionary, realistic, progressive agenda from a Republican candidate yet. Most of the plethora of Republicans lining up to run seem to want to go back in time. Many of those shouting the loudest just want to ensure that the rich get even richer, that women don\u2019t have equal workplace rights or personal choices, that big businesses be permitted to run rampant over startups, that government doesn\u2019t work to make the air and water cleaner or the Earth safer.</p>", "<p>Hillary\u2019s answer would be that someone has to lead the Democrats espousing her principles so why shouldn\u2019t she do it?</p>", "<p>Running for president is a nightmare. Candidates have to appease their bases but also have to fight for the affection of the middle-of-the-road voter, often disgusted by the discordant noise at both extremes.</p>", "<p>Will Hillary running for president against a throng of people who hate her bring rational debate to the process and a sense that we\u2019re adults sorting through our differences? No.</p>", "<p>On the other hand, we may be beyond political civility. Perhaps we are entrenched in an era of negativity that can\u2019t be cured with another political election, whether or not reasonable people are at the table. Perhaps we need an invasion of space aliens determined to kill us all and take over our planet for its water before we learn to put aside our differences and work together.</p>", "<p>We are more jaded than we were in 2008 when Hillary ran against Obama and we bought his promise of hope, change and common purpose, his dream of one United States.</p>", "<p>Americans, passionate in love of country despite its failures, want to be idealistic. But we are tired of being fooled, toyed with, lied to and manipulated. Hope is a commodity we\u2019re not sure we believe in any more.</p>", "<p>Before you run, think it through, Hillary.

Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s former finance director has been indicted on charges of filing fictitious reports that misstated contributions for a Hollywood fund-raising gala for the senator, the Justice Department said yesterday.\n</p>", "<p>\n The indictment, rare for a political campaign, was unsealed in Los Angeles charging David Rosen with four counts of filing false reports with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The charges focus on an Aug. 12, 2000, dinner and concert supported by more than $1.1 million in \u201cin-kind contributions\u201d \u2014 goods and services provided for free or below cost. The event was estimated to cost more than $1.2 million.\n</p>", "<p>\n The FBI previously said in court papers that it had evidence the former first lady\u2019s campaign deliberately understated its fund-raising costs so it would have more money to spend on her campaign.\n</p>", "<p>\n While the event allegedly cost more than $1.2 million, the indictment said, Rosen reported contributions of about $400,000, knowing the figure to be false.\n</p>", "<p>\n The indictment charged that he provided some documents to an FEC compliance officer but withheld true costs of the event and provided false documents to substantiate the lower figure.\n</p>", "<p>\n In one instance, Rosen obtained and delivered a fraudulent invoice stating the cost of a concert associated with the gala was $200,000 when he knew that figure was false, according to the indictment. The actual cost was more than $600,000.\n</p>", "<p>\n Each of the four counts of making a false statement carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines.\n</p>", "<p>\n Rosen\u2019s attorney, Paul Mark Sandler, did not return a call asking for comment. Clinton\u2019s lawyer on campaign-finance matters, David Kendall, had no immediate comment.\n</p>", "<p>\n The money from the fund-raiser went to Clinton\u2019s successful campaign for a Senate seat from New York, the Democrats\u2019 national Senate campaign organization and a state Democratic Party committee.\n</p>", "<p>\n The joint fund raising made the rules more complicated because the gala raised both \u201chard money\u201d \u2014 funds given to candidates subject to federal limits \u2014 and \u201csoft money\u201d that was unregulated and unlimited under the former campaign-finance law.\n</p>", "<p>\n Underreporting the cost of the event allowed the committee to spend less of the hard money, contributions that unlike soft money could be used to cover Clinton\u2019s campaigning costs.\n</p>", "<p>\n Most allegations of  irregularities are handled  through the FEC, although the Justice Department has investigated such matters in the past.\n</p>", "<p>\n During former President Clinton\u2019s administration, a Justice Department campaign-finance task force charged more than two dozen individuals and two corporations with fund-raising abuses from the 1996 election.

Ahead of celebrating his 70th birthday on Friday, Clinton said he would resign from the board and would only accept contributions from U.S. citizens and independent charities if his wife was elected president.</p>", "<p>Amid criticism of cronyism from Republicans, the changes aimed to address how the Clinton Foundation would function in the event of another Clinton presidency and push back against Donald Trump\u2019s critique that the sprawling foundation had created conflict of interests and allowed foreign governments to peddle influence with Hillary Clinton.</p>", "<p>Under the changes, the foundation would no longer take money from any foreign entity, government, foreign or domestic corporations, or corporate charities. A Clinton spokesman said the former president will also refrain from delivering paid speeches until the November election and will no longer give paid speeches if Hillary Clinton is elected.</p>", "<p>At the staff meeting, Clinton said he and his daughter did not face any external pressure to make the changes, but wanted to avoid any potential issues or second guessing for Hillary Clinton should she move into the White House.</p>", "<p>Republicans said the changes fell short and urged the Clinton Foundation to immediately stop receiving foreign donations. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the foundation \u201cshould immediately cease accepting foreign donations and return every penny ever taken from other countries, several of which have atrocious human rights records and ties to terrorism.\u201d</p>", "<p>Priebus said the foundation\u2019s continued acceptance of foreign donations during Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign was a \u201cmassive, ongoing conflict of interest that gets bigger by the day.\u201d</p>", "<p>The sprawling charitable network, founded after Bill Clinton left office in 2001, has raised more than $2 billion for initiatives focused on global health, climate change, economic development and increasing opportunities for women and girls.</p>", "<p>While Hillary Clinton stepped down from its board after launching her 2016 campaign, her husband and daughter have remained in leadership roles, prompting questions about the ability of the organization to continue its work during a future Clinton administration.</p>", "<p>Some of the group\u2019s funding has come from foreign donations and political donors to the Clinton family. Money accepted from countries such as Saudi Arabia drew scrutiny from both Republicans and Democrats early in Clinton\u2019s presidential bid.</p>", "<p>When Clinton served as secretary of state, the foundation reached an agreement with the Obama administration to prohibit, and in some cases curtail, foreign donations to its programs. But questions persist about the level of influence foundation donors had at the State Department. That criticism intensified after emails from Clinton\u2019s time at the department were made public as part of a lawsuit.</p>", "<p>After she left the State Department, the foundation resumed accepting donations from overseas. Bowing to pressure in April 2015, the group announced that it would restrict donations to only six Western nations and disclose its donors more frequently.</p>", "<p>Former Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana who questioned Hillary Clinton at length about the foundation and potential conflicts of interest in her 2009 nomination hearing, said this week that he was hopeful that she would make a clean break from the foundation if she\u2019s elected president.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe Clintons, as they approach the presidency, if they are successful, will have to work with their attorneys to make certain that rules of the road are drawn up to give confidence to them and the American public that there will not be favoritism,\u201d Lugar said.</p>", "<p>Members of the Clinton Foundation board ratified the changes Thursday. The decision means that the former president will convene in September his 12th and final Clinton Global Initiative, an annual meeting that coincided with the U.N.

Clinton, also a Methodist, plans to do the same.</p>", "<p>Edwards, who has proposed an ambitious set of anti-poverty programs that he says would eliminate poverty in 30 years, took the opportunity to portray the plight of the poor as a stark test of religious convictions.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt is the great moral issue of our time,\u201d Edwards said.</p>", "<p>Obama, when asked if \u201cGod is on the side\u201d of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, turned to an admonition from Lincoln that even in a war for just causes a nation must be wary of acting unjustly.</p>", "<p>Obama called the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, \u201cevil\u201d acts but, without naming President Bush, clearly criticized the president\u2019s frequent characterizations of the U.S. struggles in the Middle East as a war against evildoers.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe danger of using good versus evil in the context of war is it may lead us to be not as critical as we should be about our own actions,\u201d said the Illinois senator.

Now, that scandal was causing a headwind for the candidate as she found her own values questioned by a key segment of New York voters. This was the delicate subject on the table one evening at a White House strategy meeting, several participants recalled. The president gazed intently at poll data and then turned to his wife. \u201cWomen,\u201d he announced, \u201cwant to know why you stayed with me.\u201d</p>", "<p>There was an awkward pause. But Hillary Clinton did not seem embarrassed. Instead, a half-smile crossed her face. \u201cYes,\u201d she responded, \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering that myself.\u201d</p>", "<p>Jabbing the air for emphasis, Bill Clinton gave his answer: \u201cBecause you\u2019re a sticker! That\u2019s what people need to know \u2014 you\u2019re a sticker. You stick at the things you care about.\u201d</p>", "<p>Five years later, Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenacity in her personal and political life has left her the most formidable figure by far in Democratic politics \u2014 and in position to make history as the first woman to become president if she runs and wins in 2008.</p>", "<p>The drama of Hillary Clinton springs from the uncertainty of the future \u2014 how far her combination of ambition, self-discipline and demonstrated political skill may take her. But the way she pursues her national opportunities will be shaped in fundamental ways by the past.</p>", "<p>The disasters of her husband\u2019s early presidency and the successes that came later inform Hillary Clinton\u2019s politics today. That same history is also key to how she is perceived by others \u2014 both Democratic insiders weighing her potential as a presidential candidate and the larger electorate that ultimately would have the final word.</p>", "<p>Although focused principally on her Senate re-election campaign next year, her advisers are informally \u2014 and in some cases not so informally \u2014 planning for a White House run.</p>", "<p>A presidential campaign, Clinton\u2019s advisers acknowledge, would raise anew many of the old questions \u2014 about her marriage, her motives, and her balance of pragmatism and principle \u2014 that she successfully answered in her 2000 race in New York. She is the most popular politician in the state, even in many traditionally Republican areas upstate.</p>", "<p>As her advisers see it, Clinton\u2019s Empire State campaign and her five years in the Senate are a potent rejoinder to a refrain commonly heard among Democrats anxious about a potential candidacy. As the skeptics see it, she could probably win a nomination by exciting Democratic partisans, but she remains too personally and ideologically polarizing a figure to win a general election. Some members of her team, discussing strategy on the condition that they not be identified by name, acknowledge that answering this skepticism is among her biggest challenges in the next two years.</p>", "<p>Whatever the outcome of the intraparty debate, the recent record makes it clear that Hillary Clinton has staked her future on precisely the same brand of centrist political strategy that her husband fashioned a decade ago \u2014 using many of the same advisers and relying on familiar tactics.</p>", "<p>The strategy, confidants say, has three elements. On social issues, it is to reassure moderate and conservative voters with such positions as her support of the death penalty, and to find rhetorical formulations on abortion and other issues \u2014 on which her position is more liberal \u2014 that she is nonetheless in sympathy with traditional values. On national security, it is to ensure that she has no votes or wavering statements that would give the GOP an opening to argue that she is not in favor of a full victory in Iraq. In her political positioning generally, it is to find occasions to prominently work across party lines \u2014 to argue that she stands for pragmatism over the partisanship that many centrist voters especially dislike about Washington.</p>", "<p>This is the same political map \u2014 updated for the new circumstance of a post-Sept. 11, 2001, world \u2014 that her husband used from 1995 on to navigate conflicts with the GOP in the budget battles of 1995 and 1996, and the impeachment drama of 1998 and 1999.</p>", "<p>Even so, there are abundant historical ironies as Hillary Clinton seeks to tread this familiar path. More than any politician still in power, she is identified with the strategic miscalculations of 1993 and 1994 that vaulted congressional Republicans into the majority status they have held since.</p>", "<p>Clinton and her advisers are operating on the bold but uncertain assumption that one of the most divisive figures of the past decade can be reintroduced to Americans as a reassuring and even uniting figure in this one.</p>", "<p>It was Newt Gingrich\u2019s success that left the then-first lady grasping for explanations \u2014 and bereft of self-confidence. Days after the soon-to-be House speaker and his GOP \u201crevolutionaries\u201d stormed to power in the midterm elections, Hillary Clinton was commiserating with Dick Morris, the mostly Republican consultant who ran Bill Clinton\u2019s Arkansas team and would soon become the most influential voice on the White House political team.</p>", "<p>In tears, as Morris recalled it, she confessed: \u201cI don\u2019t know which direction is up or down. Everything I thought was right was wrong.\u201d</p>", "<p>She was the architect of the failed health-care reform effort, the unpopularity of which helped fuel Republican success. Her dominant role in how to handle questions relating to the Clintons\u2019 investment in the Whitewater land deal had not prevented the controversy from metastasizing into a major distraction from the presidency. And two of her closest friends and former law partners had come to grief in Washington \u2014 Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster Jr. by suicide, Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell by financial scandal \u2014 with both cases causing major controversy for the administration.</p>", "<p>The strategy that Hillary Clinton relies on today has its origins in the repositioning Morris crafted in those bleak days of early 1995. Here is another irony, because as a conservative commentator he is now one of her most vehement critics.</p>", "<p>The strategy Morris advocated \u2014 centrist positioning on the budget, and emphasis on small but concrete actions and rhetorical statements to underscore the incumbent\u2019s values \u2014 came with relative ease to Bill Clinton. An accommodator by nature, he was instinctively comfortable with the split-the-difference brand of politics that Morris called \u201ctriangulation.\u201d</p>", "<p>For Hillary Clinton, current and former aides acknowledge, it has been a much more arduous journey. These days, aides tout her willingness to sponsor bipartisan legislation and to enjoy a cordial relationship with Sen. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., one of the leaders of the effort to impeach her husband. But in the early days of the Clinton White House, she was known for her zeal for combat. Her instinct was to regard political opponents with deep personal antagonism; she was certain they regarded her the same way.</p>", "<p><br>\n</p>", "<p><strong>Enemies at the gate</strong></p>", "<p></p>", "<p>In 1993, White House aide Rahm Emanuel \u2014 now a Democratic House member from Illinois \u2014 planned an event inviting prominent Republicans to a White House dinner as a way of garnering support for the North American Free Trade Agreement. He assumed he would win praise for a clever tactical maneuver. Instead, the first lady was infuriated. \u201cWhat are you doing inviting these people in my home?\u201d she said, according to people familiar with the episode. Nearly sobbing with anger, she told him: \u201cThese people are our enemies. They are trying to destroy us.\u201d</p>", "<p>It was on health care that her early instincts to regard compromise as weakness had the most consequential effect. By the middle of 1994, it had become apparent to most of the White House political team that what the president had announced as his non-negotiable goal \u2014 health insurance for every citizen \u2014 was unattainable. He was eager to signal a willingness to settle on a lesser but still considerable target \u2014 95 percent of the population covered. But she argued that anything less than 100 percent coverage would not represent an intellectually coherent solution to the problem.</p>", "<p>One day in July 1994, the president was in Massachusetts when he slipped off message and announced that he would consider 95 percent coverage a victory. Hillary Clinton was at the White House when she got word of her husband\u2019s statement, and soon she was on the phone with him. \u201cWhat the (expletive) are you doing up there?\u201d she demanded, according to an aide who overheard the conversation. \u201cYou get back here right away.\u201d The next day, Clinton retracted his statement.</p>", "<p><br>\n</p>", "<p><strong>A loyal, diverse staff</strong></p>", "<p></p>", "<p>Stories of Hillary Clinton\u2019s occasionally fierce temper have led to perceptions that she is privately shrewish. Yet very few people who have worked closely with her over the years regard her that way. To the contrary, she has inspired a loyalty among staff that has kept many top aides by her side for more than a decade.</p>", "<p>Even as she has gradually modulated her public image, her political team is a composite of people from different chapters of her political life. From the 1992 presidential campaign, longtime aide Patti Solis Doyle and consultant Mandy Grunwald retain central roles. So, especially, does pollster Mark Penn, who was brought into the Clinton fold during the Morris era and is her chief strategist. Two veterans of the 2000 Senate campaign, Howard Wolfson on communications issues and Neera Tanden on policy, are important advisers. Longtime friends Harold Ickes, Ann Lewis and Maggie Williams remain in the fold in either formal or advisory roles.</p>", "<p>By the time of her 2000 campaign, Hillary Clinton had long since recognized, along with her husband, that Democrats needed to temper their ideology and modulate their message.</p>", "<p>There were two questions at stake as she sought election in her own right \u2014 both of which would re-emerge on a national scale if she sought the presidency. One was whether a woman who, early in her days in the public spotlight, was branded \u2014 some advisers say unfairly \u2014 as being far more liberal than her husband could reintroduce herself as a pragmatic creature of the center.</p>", "<p>The other was more delicate. Her polls consistently showed people were skeptical about her authenticity \u2014 doubts that were often inspired by speculation about her marriage and her ambition.</p>", "<p>In a typical 2000 strategy memo, Penn warned the Clintons, \u201cJewish swing voters feel a strong sense of cultural distance from the first lady, which leads them to question her motives and assume she is motivated primarily by personal goals.\u201d She answered the doubts in part through relentless personal exposure. The effort paid dividends in surprising places. She won only 11 of the counties outside New York City but ran competitively in many of them. Combining that with the overwhelming Democratic vote in New York, she trounced Rep. Rick Lazio (R).</p>", "<p>The speculation about the Clinton marriage is not confined to ordinary voters. In the White House years and since then, it has been a common topic of discussion among Clinton friends and aides. With few exceptions, most of these people concluded that the marriage is a genuine if turbulent romance, powered by a shared sense of mission about politics and government. The role reversal between husband and wife in 2000 strengthened the marriage, some friends say.</p>", "<p>The unseasoned Senate candidate once confided to Ickes, \u201cI never realized how good Bill was at this until I tried to do it.\u201d</p>", "<p>Still uncertain is whether Hillary Clinton can prove her husband\u2019s equal in presidential politics. In interviews, she insists the question is not on her mind \u2014 only next year\u2019s re-election.</p>", "<p>Privately, her advisers say she may not have decided to run but she has definitely decided she wants to do everything necessary to keep her options open and allow her to launch a campaign if she decides to after 2006. Her out-of-state travel is increasingly strategic, including trips to swing states such as Ohio.</p>", "<p>In 2000, she repeatedly pledged that she would finish her term without seeking the presidency. Aides say she will not issue such a pledge this time. To emphasize her centrist credentials, her Senate office regularly touts her willingness to sponsor legislation with Republicans, including conservative Sens. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Sam Brownback of Kansas. In her first years in the Senate, she focused largely on New York issues and carefully rationed national publicity.

Really none of the other candidates exist in the realm that Clinton and Obama occupy.\u201d</p>", "<p>The New York senator was viewed favorably by 83 percent of black voters, compared to Obama\u2019s 74 percent. About 10 percent of those surveyed viewed Clinton and Obama negatively. The national survey, conducted between Oct. 5 and Nov. 2, asked 750 African Americans who were likely to vote in primaries or attend caucuses about the presidential candidates and related issues.</p>", "<p>Although some people were surveyed more than a month ago and the two campaigns have exchanged heated criticism in recent weeks, Bositis said the results are still reliable. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking them how they\u2019re going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them what are more stable feelings they have toward issues and candidates.\u201d</p>", "<p>The survey showed a small gender gap: African-American women chose Clinton as their clear favorite with favorable ratings of 86 percent. In the 2004 presidential election, almost 60 percent of all black voters were women, according to the Census Bureau.</p>", "<p>One reason for Clinton\u2019s edge may come from her name recognition, Bositis said, pointing to the publicity she has received as first lady and a senator during the last 15 years.</p>", "<p>Cornell Belcher, a pollster for Obama\u2019s campaign, agreed that name recognition was the likely explanation: \u201cIt\u2019s a favorable rating, which is really more of an ID rating than anything else.\u201d</p>", "<p>He also noted that the primary battles are fought state-by-state. \u201cThese national polls are kind of meaningless in the overall political scheme of things because there\u2019s no national primary,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>Bositis said another possible reason for Clinton\u2019s lead in the poll was the economic success African Americans experienced during her husband\u2019s time in the White House. During former President Bill Clinton\u2019s second term, the black population\u2019s annual median household income increased by $5,000, according to the bureau.</p>", "<p>Clinton\u2019s high ratings also might stem from electability issues; some people may doubt an African American can win the presidency. \u201cThere are many blacks in the South who really as of yet do not believe an African American is going to be elected president,\u201d Bositis said, referring to the Illinois senator.</p>", "<p>But some argue that blacks are no longer skeptical of electing the first black president.</p>", "<p>\u201cThere was that time when there was sort of hesitation, but I think we\u2019re really moving beyond that,\u201d said Dewey Clayton, a political-science professor at the University of Louisville.</p>", "<p>Still, the race is far from over.

She took several questions from nurses and some patients, too, who told of battles with insurance companies.</p>", "<p>Clinton\u2019s plan calls for mandated universal coverage, while Obama\u2019s does not require health insurance for everyone. Instead, he would expand Medicaid and offer subsidies to make health care more affordable.</p>", "<p>In an interview after Friday\u2019s rally, Clinton said Obama doesn\u2019t support universal coverage because \u201cit wasn\u2019t worth the fight, it wasn\u2019t something he was willing to go to the mat over.\u201d</p>", "<p>Here is an edited transcript of the interview:</p>", "<p><strong>Clinton:</strong> Senator Obama\u2019s campaign is all about bringing people together. But the question is, for what, and against whom? Because you\u2019re not going to obliterate the differences that exist. You\u2019re not going to eliminate the health-insurance companies and the drug companies. So you have to be prepared to put together a coalition, but be willing to fight for what you believe in.</p>", "<p>I think the American people deserve a president who\u2019s a fighter and a doer and champion, not a talker. And from my perspective, standing up and fighting for universal health care is a core Democratic value.</p>", "<p>Picture the debate with Senator [John] McCain: He\u2019s going to stand up and say he\u2019s going to have health-savings accounts and he\u2019s going to have tax credits and he\u2019s going to cover a lot of people. So if you go into that already having ceded universal health care and basically using, as Barack now is, Republican and health-insurance talking points \u2026 there\u2019s no real distinction.</p>", "<p><strong>The Seattle Times:</strong> After Iowa of course there was a lot of talk about change. Everybody wanted it. Both parties talked about it. What was surprising in a way, given the troubled years of the Bush administration, why wasn\u2019t that where everybody started? Obama did start with change, but others were slower to come around to that.</p>", "<p><strong>Clinton:</strong> Well, I just don\u2019t agree. I can only speak for myself. I think number one, having the first woman president is a sea change of enormous proportions. It changes everything about how we view ourselves, how the world views us. Maybe it was so self-evident it didn\u2019t need to be talked about so much.</p>", "<p>Also, everything that I have proposed is a dramatic change from the status quo, which is George W. Bush and the Republicans.</p>", "<p>I never saw contradiction between change and experience. I think you have to have the strength and experience to make the changes that we want. \u2026 I think change is the goal, but experience is the means to achieve the goal.</p>", "<p><strong>The Seattle Times:</strong> Do you think you may have been hurt in that you are so well-known in America, people aren\u2019t shocked you are a woman running for president? They feel like they\u2019re comfortable with you already, so how could this be revolutionary?</p>", "<p><strong>Clinton:</strong> That\u2019s an interesting point. I haven\u2019t thought about it. \u2026 You know, being a woman gives me a whole different perspective. We\u2019ve never had a daughter or a wife or a mother or a sister in the White House. And I\u2019m not sure people fully grasp what a change that might be. \u2026</p>", "<p>It feels like people are kind of sorting all of this out and making sense of it.</p>", "<p><strong>The Seattle Times:</strong> None of the candidates comes here and talks about trade. \u2026 Is there a trade agenda that you have and that should be part of this campaign debate? Or have we all kind of agreed on trade?</p>", "<p><strong>Clinton:</strong> I think that Democrats and progressives have concluded that we do need to take a look at how we conduct trade, that the debate between free trade and fair trade is kind of a 20th-century debate. We need a 21st-century debate.</p>", "<p>I talk about smart, pro-American trade. I talk about how we need a timeout to really look at where we are with trade. I believe we can compete and compete well around the world.</p>", "<p>This state produces a lot of exports, and we want to not only continue that but expand it. But at the same time, we do have to be much more conscious of the way trade can be used to raise standards of living, raise environmental standards.</p>", "<p>We can use trade as part of our global-warming agenda. There\u2019s a lot we have to re-imagine about trade. It may be that because we are making a transition in trade it\u2019s not talked about so much because people are having to work through exactly what we mean about it.</p>", "<p><em>David Postman: 360-236-8267 or <a href=\"mailto:dpostman@seattletimes.com\" class=\"content-link\">dpostman@seattletimes.com</a></em></p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Clinton focuses on health care      "]}

Gillon, who won Clinton and Gingrich\u2019s cooperation for his 2008 book, \u201cThe Pact: Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich and the Rivalry that Defined a Generation.\u201d For a \u201cvery fertile period \u2026 they worked behind the scenes crafting significant legislation that had a positive impact on the economy. And they were doing so at great risk.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cConservatives didn\u2019t trust him,\u201d recalled John Feehery, an aide at the time to House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, who chaperoned Gingrich to meetings with the president to keep them from making deals. Throughout the four years Clinton\u2019s aides, too, maneuvered to keep the president and House speaker from being alone together, according to Gillon\u2019s book.</p>", "<p>As part of the 1997 balanced budget deal, Gingrich agreed to a proposal to give block grants to states to pay for health care for uninsured children who didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid. The deal forced Republicans to swallow a major new entitlement, the largest expansion of taxpayer-financed health insurance coverage for children since Medicaid began in the 1960s.</p>", "<p>Many Republicans saw the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program as too much government involvement in private industry and a step toward the mandated health insurance championed by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Gingrich not only supported the idea, he backed SCHIP\u2019s reauthorization in 2007.</p>", "<p>The budget deal marked a change in the pair\u2019s relationship from the days after the 1994 Republican \u201crevolution\u201d that made Gingrich speaker \u2013 and the two government shutdowns the following year. By striking the massive budget act, \u201cThey realized they could accomplish more by working together, even if that meant abandoning the liberal and conservative wings of their respective parties,\u201d Gillon writes.</p>", "<p>Gingrich and Clinton tried to do even more together, convening a secret meeting on Oct. 28, 1997, in the Treaty Room of the White House on revamping Social Security and Medicare \u2013 for which centrists would be the key to passage, Gillon wrote. The plan was for Clinton to propose reforming entitlements in his State of the Union speech, while Gingrich would respond with supportive words. But a week before the president\u2019s annual speech to the nation, the story broke about Clinton\u2019s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.</p>", "<p>\u201cI knew it was over,\u201d Gingrich reflected of his partnership with Clinton, according to the book. Under fire from conservatives after his own lieutenants tried to overthrow him, Gingrich left Congress in January 1999. The House impeached Clinton on charges connected to his testimony about an affair, but the Senate acquitted him.</p>", "<p>Fast-forward a dozen years, and Gingrich is casting his role in the 1990s economy his way.</p>", "<p>\u201cThis country has enormous potential \u2026 to balance the budget, as we did for four years when I was speaker,\u201d Gingrich said on Fox News.</p>", "<p>In fact, the national debt went up, not down, during the four years Gingrich was speaker. In January 1995, when he assumed the leadership position, the gross national debt was $4.8 trillion. When he left four years later, it was $5.6 trillion, an increase of $800 billion.</p>", "<p>As for annual deficits, he did not preside over a four-year period of balanced budgets. In the 1996 and 1997 budget years, the first two years he influenced as speaker, the government ran deficits. In 1998 and 1999, the government ran surpluses.</p>", "<p>Washington achieved surpluses for two years after that, making four consecutive years of black ink. But Gingrich only had a hand in the first two.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Gingrich, Clinton had stormy partnership      "]}

A more diverse country is a more fractious and polarized country, and over the past few weeks white Republicans have been coming home to their candidate.</p>", "<p>I see some truth in those theories, especially the last one. But my single explanation would be this: Clintonworld is a semi-closed system that operates according to its own calendar. Donald Trump is egregious, but at least he\u2019s living in the 21st century, as was Bernie Sanders. Clintonworld operates according to its own time-space continuum that is slightly akilter from our own.</p>", "<p>In the 21st century, politics operates around a different axis. It\u2019s not left/right, big government/small government. It\u2019s openness and dynamism versus closedness and security. It\u2019s between those who see opportunity and excitement in the emerging globalized, multiethnic meritocracy against those who see their lives and communities threatened by it.</p>", "<p>In the 21st century, the parties are amassing different coalitions. People are dividing along human capital lines, with the college educated flocking to the Democrats and the non-college educated whites flocking to the GOP. Democrats do great in America\u2019s 100 most crowded counties, but they struggle in the 3,000 less crowded ones.</p>", "<p>Clintonworld is a decades-old interlocking network of donors and friends that hasn\u2019t quite caught up to these fundamental shifts. That\u2019s because Clintonworld, in the Hillary iteration, is often defensive, distrusting and oriented around avoiding errors. In each of her national campaigns, Clinton has run against in-touch-with-the-times men who were more charismatic and generated more passion than she did. She\u2019s always been the duller, unfashionable foil.</p>", "<p>Her donor base and fundraising style is out of another era. Obama and Sanders tapped into the energized populist base, but Clinton has Barbra Streisand, Cher and a cast of Wall Street plutocrats. Her campaign proposals sidestep the cutting issues that have driven Trump, Sanders, Brexit and the other key movements of modern politics. Her ideas for reducing poverty are fine, but they are circa Ed Muskie: more public works jobs, housing tax credits, more money for Head Start.</p>", "<p>Her out-of-time style costs her big with millennials. If she loses this election it will be because younger voters just don\u2019t relate to her and flock to Gary Johnson instead. It also leads to a weird imbalance in the national debate.</p>", "<p>We have an emerging global system, with relatively open trade, immigration, multilateral institutions and ethnic diversity. The critics of that system are screaming at full roar. The champions of that system \u2014 and Hillary Clinton is naturally one \u2014 are off in another world.</p>", "<p>There is a strong case to be made for an open world order, and a huge majority coalition to be built in support of it.

So did Eleanor and Jackie. Eleanor actually suggested divorce. Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s mother would have none of it. She threatened to cut her son from his inheritance if he didn\u2019t give up his liaison with Lucy Mercer, which he didn\u2019t. Eleanor nevertheless went on to champion great causes, and FDR remains one of America\u2019s most revered leaders.</p>", "<p>John F. Kennedy\u2019s sexual adventures were probably far more numerous than Bill Clinton\u2019s and definitely more dangerous. One of JFK\u2019s women was a party girl with mob ties, and another widely regarded as a spy for communist East Germany. Despite it all, Jackie genuinely grieved for John after his untimely death.</p>", "<p>None of these first ladies condoned her husband\u2019s wanderings. They endured them. And their marriages went on.</p>", "<p>In the older moral tradition, adultery was a matter for adults to work out among themselves. But divorce hurts children. Thus, divorce also wrecked political careers.</p>", "<p>In 1963, former U.S. Sen. Prescott Bush (George W.\u2019s grandfather) refused to back the presidential candidacy of his friend New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller over divorce. \u201cHave we come to the point where a governor can desert his wife and children?\u201d Bush fulminated.</p>", "<p>A married man who paraded publicly with his mistress, as Trump has done, inhabited an entirely lower category of scoundrel than the conventional sneak. Bill Clinton, for all his weaknesses, never intended his frolics to become public.</p>", "<p>In a perfect world, Hillary would have withheld criticism of Bill\u2019s trysting mates. But there are mitigating circumstances. A woman is entitled to dislike her husband\u2019s paramours. And her reference to Gennifer Flowers as a \u201cfailed cabaret singer\u201d came at a time when she genuinely did not believe the Flowers story.</p>", "<p>In the case of Bill\u2019s fling with Monica Lewinsky, more than a political career was at stake. The presidency was.</p>", "<p>Hillary\u2019s calling Lewinsky a \u201cnarcissistic looney tune\u201d may have been overdoing it, but the first lady thought she was saying it in confidence to a friend.</p>", "<p>It needs repeating that Bill Clinton\u2019s partners were all consenting adults. Unsubstantiated claims that Clinton physically forced himself on women \u2014 or that Trump did the same \u2014 can be dismissed.</p>", "<p>The real outrage of the Lewinsky frenzy was its paralyzing effect on Washington. Governance froze for months as Clinton\u2019s tormentors danced around the maypole with Monica\u2019s blue dress.</p>", "<p>The American public eventually tired of the inquisition and turned on the inquisitors. Hillary\u2019s popularity soared. In the next midterm election, Democrats actually gained seats in the House. At the end, Bill Clinton left office with a higher approval rating than did Ronald Reagan.</p>", "<p>For all of Bill\u2019s bad behavior, the Clintons appear to be a solidly married couple joined in political passion. Like Eleanor and Jackie before her, Hillary has been no partner in crime \u2014 and she\u2019s not getting a divorce.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Clinton is no \u2018enabler\u2019      "]}

Her rival Barack Obama was planning his own meeting Monday with Edwards, who confidants said was torn over which candidate to back.</p>", "<p>Campaign aides said Solis Doyle made the decision to leave on her own and was not urged to do so by the former first lady or any other senior member of the team. But it comes as Clinton struggles to catch Obama in fundraising and momentum and faces the prospect of losing every voting contest yet to come in February.</p>", "<p>Solis Doyle announced the shift in an e-mail to the staff on Sunday.</p>", "<p>\u201cI have been proud to manage this campaign and prouder still to call Hillary my friend for more than 16 years,\u201d Solis Doyle wrote. \u201cMaggie is a remarkable person and I am confident that she will do a fabulous job.\u201d</p>", "<p>Solis Doyle said she will serve as a senior adviser to Clinton and the campaign, and travel with Clinton from time to time.</p>", "<p>Williams, who served as Clinton\u2019s White House chief of staff, joined the campaign after the New York senator narrowly won the New Hampshire primary Jan. 8. She will begin assuming the duties of campaign manager this week.</p>", "<p>\u201cI think this is one of the most important things I could be doing,\u201d Williams told The Associated Press. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can accept one of these jobs unless you care about the future.\u201d</p>", "<p>After Clinton\u2019s third-place finish in Iowa, Williams and other top strategists were brought aboard to help hone the political operation and sharpen Clinton\u2019s message. According to campaign aides, Solis Doyle, who has two young children, made the decision to step down as campaign manager at the time and agreed to stay on until Super Tuesday, Feb. 5.</p>", "<p>The staff shake-up caps a week in which Clinton grabbed the bigger prizes on Super Tuesday, winning New York, California and New Jersey, but Obama prevailed in more contests. Obama won the popular vote in 13 states, while Clinton won in eight states and American Samoa.</p>", "<p>Both Clinton and Obama have been competitive in fundraising for most of the campaign; each raised more than $100 million last year. In the last few weeks, however, Clinton lagged behind Obama as he raised $32 million in January to her $13.5 million, forcing her to lend her campaign $5 million before Super Tuesday. The campaign said Saturday that it had raised $10 million since the beginning of February.</p>", "<p>Obama enjoyed a three-state sweep Saturday night, winning the Louisiana primary and caucuses in Washington state and Nebraska. He has the potential to pad his victories in contests Tuesday in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, as well as next week in Wisconsin and his native Hawaii.</p>", "<p>Clinton is hoping to prevail on March 4 when Ohio, Texas, Rhode Island and Vermont vote.</p>", "<p>In a statement, Clinton praised Solis Doyle and said she looked forward to her continued advice in the coming months.</p>", "<p>\u201cPatti Solis Doyle has done an extraordinary job in getting us to this point _ within reach of the nomination _ and I am enormously grateful for her friendship and her outstanding work,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd, as Patti has said, this already has been the longest presidential campaign in history and one that has required enormous sacrifices of everyone and our families.</p>", "<p>\u201cI look forward to her continued advice in the months ahead,\u201d Clinton added.</p>", "<p>\u201cPatti and I have worked with Maggie Williams for more than a decade,\u201d Clinton said in the statement. \u201cI am lucky to have Maggie on board and I know she will lead our campaign with great skill towards the nomination.\u201d</p>", "<p>The daughter of Mexican immigrants who cut her political teeth in Chicago, Solis Doyle served as Clinton\u2019s scheduler for eight years in the White House and began overseeing her political operation during her first run for Senate in 2000.</p>", "<p>But Solis Doyle\u2019s appointment as Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign manager last year surprised many Democratic operative including some in Clinton\u2019s inner circle, who believed she did not have sufficient political experience to run the operation.</p>", "<p>Clinton aides loyal to Solis Doyle say she proved the naysayers wrong, smoothly managing a staff of several hundred and a budget that swelled to well over $100 million while leaving most of the campaign\u2019s major strategic decisions to others _ particularly Clinton pollster Mark Penn and media adviser Mandy Grunwald. But she was also criticized by others for, among other things, failing to anticipate and plan for Obama\u2019s fundraising prowess.</p>", "<p>Money will be crucial for a drawn-out fight for the party\u2019s nomination, an historic struggle between Clinton, who is seeking to become the first female commander in chief, and Obama, who would be the first black president.</p>", "<p>The Democratic Party\u2019s system of awarding pledged delegates proportionally and the oversized role of superdelegates, the 796 lawmakers, governors and party officials who are not bound by state votes, meant that no candidate had a commanding lead.</p>", "<p>According to The Associated Press\u2019 latest survey, Clinton had 243 superdelegates and Obama had 156.

In a taped video, with no audience and no family members, she presented herself first and foremost as a senator and experienced Washington hand, ready to fight for Democratic goals and unintimidated by threats from the GOP.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe will make history and remake our future,\u201d she said, but she left it to others to note that she was, by far, the most serious female candidate either party had considered sending forth as its contender for the White House.</p>", "<p>In the long and difficult campaign that followed, the support Clinton enjoyed from other women was probably the single greatest source of her strength. Women staffed her campaign headquarters from her first victory in New Hampshire to her last one in South Dakota, and women provided most of the votes she received. Yet even as they rallied behind her, she steadfastly refused to cast her candidacy in gender terms.</p>", "<p>Which made it all the more striking that last week, when her dogged challenge to Barack Obama finally came to an end, and she had to put it all in perspective, she defined her race \u2014 and its long-term influence \u2014 in such strikingly feminist terms.</p>", "<p>\u201cI ran as a daughter who benefited from opportunities my mother never dreamed of,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI ran as a mother who worries about my daughter\u2019s future and a mother who wants to leave all children brighter tomorrows. To build that future I see, we must make sure that women and men alike understand the struggles of their grandmothers and their mothers, and that women enjoy equal opportunities, equal pay and equal respect. Let us resolve and work toward achieving very simple propositions: There are no acceptable limits and there are no acceptable prejudices in the 21st century.\u201d</p>", "<p>Seeking enlightenment on what had turned Clinton in this unexpected direction for her valedictory, I turned to Ann Lewis, the veteran Clinton political aide and longtime friend of hers.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always who Hillary has been,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it became more important to acknowledge it explicitly, as she saw the reaction of her women supporters to the level of sexism and hostility to a woman running that was part of the standard media. We have achieved a lot, but we have to acknowledge what we\u2019ve learned the hard way.\u201d</p>", "<p>Lewis was referring to the list of grievances compiled by pro-Clinton women with some of the cable television, network and print journalists who covered the campaign. Like every other reporter on the hustings, I heard these complaints \u2014 and thought some were legitimate. For Clinton, apparently, it is important that they be acknowledged.</p>", "<p>Being Clinton, the candidate is unbowed. She has not allowed herself to indulge the self-pity or voice the bitterness heard too often from her husband. She fell a couple of hundred delegate votes short of wresting the nomination from Obama, but, she said, look at what she did achieve. If people still wonder, \u201cCould a woman really serve as commander in chief? Well, I think we answered that one.\u201d</p>", "<p>In the future, she said, \u201cit will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories, unremarkable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee, unremarkable to think that a woman can be the president of the United States. And that is truly remarkable.\u201d</p>", "<p>It truly is. And whatever the fates have in store for this woman, in 2012 or any other year, it is certain that this campaign will be seen as a major step forward for her \u2014 and for other women. With Ted Kennedy\u2019s illness, she has no rival as the most influential Democrat on Capitol Hill. She came closer to breaking the White House barrier than any woman in history. Some day, she or someone else will go all the way. Whoever that is will owe Clinton\u2019s 2008 run a huge debt.</p>", "<p><em>David S.

Caucus results were incomplete late Tuesday night.</p>", "<p>Tuesday\u2019s results mean the Democrats\u2019 chaotic and increasingly rancorous nominating process will almost certainly drag on to the next big faceoff in Pennsylvania.</p>", "<p>Democrats worry whether the damage from the fight might hurt their party in the fall campaign.</p>", "<p>If nothing else, the final week of the campaigns in Texas and Ohio showed much tougher tactics, leading Democrats to wonder how much damage the party could suffer, especially as the Republicans are settled on McCain as their nominee.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe know no matter what, this race is going to Pennsylvania and it\u2019s even more likely this could go all through June,\u201d Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d</p>", "<p>Wyoming will hold caucuses Saturday, and Mississippi has a primary Tuesday. But neither is likely to reshape the essential dynamic of the contest.</p>", "<p>Although she\u2019s claiming momentum and the label of \u201ccomeback kid,\u201d Clinton faces an uphill climb. Unless she gets roughly 60 percent of the delegates in each of the upcoming contests, she cannot catch Obama, who leads by about 100 delegates. That has led some to say she should bow out of the race.</p>", "<p>That seemed unlikely Tuesday night. At a raucous victory party in Ohio\u2019s capital city, the New York senator told a ballroom full of backers, \u201cAs Ohio goes, so goes the nation. Well, this nation\u2019s coming back and so is this campaign.\u201d</p>", "<p>On Tuesday, voters responded as they have throughout the campaign, turning out in record numbers.</p>", "<p>In Ohio, they braved raw, late-winter weather, including freezing rain in the north and flood warnings across most of the state. Citing the conditions, and a shortage of paper ballots in some precincts, state officials went to court to extend the polling hours in several places.</p>", "<p>Obama, bidding to become the nation\u2019s first black president, entered the day with 12 consecutive victories and hoped to force Clinton from the race by taking Ohio and Texas. A combination of factors helped push Clinton in the winner\u2019s circle, political observers said, and most occurred in the last few days before the primaries. Not only did she consistently emphasize national security and experience, but she portrayed Obama as weak and out of his league when it came to serious foreign policy and security issues.</p>", "<p>Additionally, her campaign hammered Obama on his relationship with friend and fundraiser Tony Rezko, whose trial in Chicago on political corruption charges started Monday.</p>", "<p>Daron Shaw, a political scientist at the University of Texas and a former Bush campaign adviser, said exit polling indicated that most undecided voters broke for her in the three days leading up to Tuesday\u2019s vote.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt looks like her campaign was able to make big gains at the end,\u201d Shaw said.</p>", "<p>Getting Obama on the defensive for the first time in the campaign is likely just the opening act for the political battle ahead.</p>", "<p>The candidates head into the Wyoming caucus Saturday, where Obama has an edge because his strong grass-roots organization has proved nearly unbeatable in caucus states.

It was a piece about a public person\u2019s appearance on the Senate floor that was surprising because of the location and because of the person. It\u2019s disingenuous to think that revealing cleavage, any amount of it, in that kind of situation is a nonissue.\u201d</p>", "<p>Stories about the physical appearance of candidates, from Al Gore\u2019s earth-tone wardrobe to John Edwards\u2019 $400 haircut to a bathing-suit shot of Barack Obama, have long been an entertaining sideshow. But since no journalist has plunged into this particular territory, given the predominantly male nature of past White House contests, Givhan\u2019s column has sparked plenty of reaction, much of it negative. Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman wrote Friday that Givhan \u201cmanaged to make a media mountain out of a half-inch valley.\u201d</p>", "<p>Clinton adviser Lewis said in an interview she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the column but initially dismissed it as \u201can inside-the-Beltway story.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize the attention and the anger it was setting off nationally,\u201d she added.

That is grossly inappropriate.\u201d</p>", "<p>For candidates, using criticism \u2014 real or perceived \u2014 to raise money is catching on as a political maneuver. After conservative author Ann Coulter mocked Edwards in March, describing him with a slur used against gays, the former North Carolina senator featured the attacks in a fundraising pitch.</p>", "<p>Givhan regularly patrols the intersection of fashion and politics. About two years ago, she chastised Vice President Dick Cheney for wearing a fur-trimmed parka rather than more formal attire to a somber ceremony in Poland marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.</p>", "<p>In April, Givhan scrutinized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her \u201cgenerous collection of scarves\u201d during a tour of the Middle East.</p>", "<p>The column on cleavage described Clinton\u2019s clothing choice, as seen on C-SPAN-2, as a \u201csmall acknowledgment of sexuality and femininity\u201d that departed from her usual \u201cdesexualized uniform\u201d of black pantsuits.</p>", "<p>Steve Reiss, The Post\u2019s deputy assistant managing editor for Style, said, \u201cRobin has consistently raised similar questions over the years about both men and women who are in the public eye. We know these people take a great deal of care in how they present themselves on TV and in public, and that is fair game for analysis.\u201d</p>", "<p>Noting that the newspaper has run dozens of articles on Clinton\u2019s policy positions and background, Reiss said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel we have anything to apologize for.\u201d</p>", "<p>Politicians often rip the media over what they see as unfavorable coverage.

After all, Henry Kissinger once described power as the great aphrodisiac. Did aphrodisia shrink a woman\u2019s political power?</p>", "<p>Of course, this was only one of innumerable pink grids put over Hillary\u2019s campaign. Her announcement was preceded and followed by endless stories on whether America was \u201cready\u201d for a woman president. Every move she makes, every breath she takes, every outfit she wears, she is stalked by the media looking for clues to the female electoral cycle.</p>", "<p>This was an inevitable part of being the First Serious Woman Candidate for President. And Hillary has said repeatedly, \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m a woman, the fact that I\u2019m a mom, is part of who I am.\u201d Her candidacy was bound to have a \u201cYou Go, Girl!\u201d edge.</p>", "<p>It was no surprise that Hillary announced her candidacy in a Webcast from a living room decorated in Early Suburban Soccer Mom. It\u2019s no surprise that she has just launched a kind of girlfriends\u2019 social networking campaign. And it\u2019s no surprise to see her campaigning under the slogan: \u201cLet the Conversation Begin.\u201d (Memo to the campaign: This female-friendly approach may strike terror in the hearts of husbands who cringe when their wives say, \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d)</p>", "<p>But something is happening on the long, tortured path to the first primary. Hillary\u2019s been de-sexed \u2014 excuse me, Sharon \u2014 de-gendered. She already is seen as less like the <em>woman</em> candidate for president and more like the <em>establishment</em> candidate. She\u2019s becoming less a messenger of historic change and more a messenger of old politics.</p>", "<p>It was once impossible to be both a woman and an establishment candidate. But in this primary, Hillary is outflanked on the left by both Barack Obama and John Edwards. The \u201cwicked witch of the left,\u201d the \u201cdesignated devil,\u201d the \u201cLady MacBeth,\u201d whose image blesses the baby onesies sold at conservative conventions \u2014 \u201cHillary Scares Me\u201d \u2014 is now the centrist in the Democratic field.</p>", "<p>This has put the Hillary-hating industry into a stock-market swoon. The \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d is losing traction. Even Richard Mellon Scaife has closed up his ATM for Clinton Bashers Inc. She\u2019s now, for better and/or worse, positioned less as a scary feminist and more as a calibrating centrist, less of an uppity woman and more of the programmed establishment scion.</p>", "<p>Obama has become the thoughtful, ruminative, philosopher-king candidate. But in the process, Hillary has come to look like the strong candidate. This may be due in part to her refusal to apologize for her vote on the Iraq war, a decision that many in hyperactive punditry regard as a huge mistake. But there\u2019s a subtext. Like it or not, it is part of this woman\u2019s morphing into the tough guy in the race.</p>", "<p>Obama has also matched or even trumped Hillary on the \u201chistoric\u201d front. Gradually, her image as \u201cthe woman\u201d faded to her image as the \u201cexperienced\u201d candidate. Not to mention the candidate most ready to take on the Republican attack machine. \u201cWhen you\u2019re attacked, you have to deck your opponents,\u201d says the former first lady. You go \u2026 <em>girl</em>?</p>", "<p>Not even the most calculating strategist could have planned this. She didn\u2019t choose her status as establishment candidate any more than she chose being attacked from the left by Hollywood mogul David Geffen. But what better enemy in the race for votes among the mainstream parents who regard the Hollywood culture as their opponent? And what better position for a woman running in the general election as a leader?</p>", "<p>There is a certain irony in sticking a politics-as-usual label on the first serious female contender. Or seeing a breakthrough candidacy cast as same-old. Democrats thirsty for change and hostile to the war may well see Obama as the fresh voice and Clinton as old guard.</p>", "<p>But have you noticed how the arguments about whether she\u2019s \u201celectable\u201d have dimmed? Have you noticed how the chatter about this woman\u2019s leadership ability has faded? Have you noticed how the stories about whether America is \u201cready\u201d for a woman have receded?</p>", "<p>Is Hillary running as a woman? I remember when Pat Schroeder was asked that question and quipped, \u201cI didn\u2019t know I had other options!\u201d But Hillary is already less the \u201cwoman candidate\u201d and more the \u201ccandidate.\u201d And the \u201cconversation\u201d has barely begun.</p>", "<p><em>Ellen Goodman\u2019s column appears Friday on editorial pages of The Times.

Sent away by this president upon his unlikely victory in 2008 against the Clinton machine and the inevitable first woman president, Hillary is back.</p>", "<p>Few people \u2014 and far fewer women \u2014 have attracted so much attention as Hillary Clinton. She carries the unique burden of being something to everyone: Loved, despised, admired, feared, a role model, a terrifying omen, politician, mother, wife, nemesis, scold, muse. She is a conundrum of one.</p>", "<p>And she <em>is</em> running for president. Isn\u2019t she?</p>", "<p>No sooner did Obama raise his right hand to begin his second term than the whispers began. This is true for Washington, at least, if nowhere else. With Clinton out of the public eye for the first time since she and her husband occupied the Arkansas governor\u2019s mansion, all eyes turned to find her.</p>", "<p>Whether to run again for the highest office is surely on Hillary\u2019s mind \u2014 searing and torturous. It was always <em>the</em> question. Her inevitability is legend. The erstwhile valedictorian who became the wife of Bill Clinton was bound for her own glory, in her own time, eventually.</p>", "<p>Then came the most unexpected thing of all \u2014 this man Obama, this <em>deus ex machina </em>who descended from some distant star to blind the masses with his light. His destiny, alas, was greater than hers and so, once again, Hillary had to wait.</p>", "<p>Will she go for it again? Will she seize her destiny? Or is it her fate to fade into the pages of missed opportunities, bad timing and broken promises?</p>", "<p>I\u2019ve asked a half-dozen close Clinton associates if she\u2019s running and they all say the same thing: \u201cI have no idea.\u201d I suspect this is true and that Hillary doesn\u2019t really know. Except that she does know, and all her colleagues really do know, and we all know. Really, don\u2019t we? How does Hillary Clinton walk away from the job that was meant to be hers? Forget fate. What about duty? Doesn\u2019t the first woman who has a real shot at becoming president of the United States have a duty to run? And win?</p>", "<p>It would be exhausting. Time wears us down and Hillary would be 69 in 2016. The past four years have been brutal and she shows the effects of constant travel, immense pressure and a rather noble lack of attention to her vanities. A presidential campaign, though more familiar, would be worse. So much engagement, so many bad meals, a terrible pace for anyone of any age, but especially for a woman who may be musing about grandchildren and doting.</p>", "<p>Then again, Hillary is no cookie baker, as we know. And the timing, finally, is right. Her popularity is at its highest level ever. She is admired around the world. She has earned her chops not by inheritance (married to Bill) but through her own sweat and, yes, tears. She has managed through hard work and quiet rectitude to erase most memories of her earlier years as first lady and of the woman who did, indeed, stand by her man when most wouldn\u2019t.</p>", "<p>Not incidentally, the women\u2019s vote is hers. Even Republican women would find it hard not to cast a ballot for Hillary. If not her, then who? And when? The Republican bench may be full, but, with the exception of Jeb Bush, it seems full of vice presidents rather than presidents. A Bush-Clinton contest might drive the country into dynastic delirium, but there would be a certain poetic symmetry: Finally the right Bush and the right Clinton.</p>", "<p>Clearly, the Hillary Clinton for president proposition poses more questions than answers. But the calculus comes down to this: She has been working toward this moment essentially all her life, diligently clearing away the brush blocking her path. The zeitgeist is ready for a woman president. Most important, she can win \u2014 and few think the country would be worse for it.</p>", "<p><em>\u00a9 , Washington Post Writers Group</em></p>", "<p><em>Kathleen Parker\u2019s column appears regularly on editorial pages of The Times.

After Mellul said the hotel had requested 50 Secret Service pins, the agent wrote, \u201cYikes.\u201d</p>", "<p>Several emails contain what is referred to as a \u201cmovement document\u201d or a \u201csite diagram\u201d involving the vice president, the first lady or Clinton. Those emails were often sent to a large number of people, including Mellul.

Here is a look at the numerous policy differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, in alphabetical order.</p>", "<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 This is a presidential campaign about trust, temperament, honesty, judgment, character and personality.</p>", "<p>It has been marked by Donald Trump\u2019s ballistic-missile tweets in the middle of the night. It\u2019s enlivened by the spectacle of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign innards spilling day after day into public view, quite a WikiMess.</p>", "<p>But beyond all of the bluster in this campaign, a clash of ideas is also at work, with consequences for nearly all Americans and plenty of people around the world.</p>", "<p>Who\u2019s really going to bust the budget \u2014 Trump with his big tax cuts or Clinton with her big spending?</p>", "<p>Which is safer for Americans \u2014 Trump\u2019s iron-border, restrictive refugee policy or Clinton\u2019s more open stance, centered on enlisting more Muslim Americans in the defense against extremism in their communities?</p>", "<p>Who will spur energy independence and how \u2014 Clinton with her faith in renewable sources and measured support for fracking or Trump with his roaring conviction that coal country can rise again?</p>", "<p>Trump\u2019s conservative credentials are suspect to many supporters, and his behavior in the campaign troubling. But the near certainty that he would put forward more conservative Supreme Court nominees than Clinton is enough to keep them on board, because the high court could well have more impact on abortion rights, gun rights and immigration than any president could. Trump foresees the end of the constitutional right to abortion if he wins and gets to seat several justices; Clinton likewise makes clear she would try to shape the court to reflect her support for abortion rights and more.</p>", "<p>Clinton proposes steps to pay for at least some of her spending, but that depends on a Congress willing to slam the rich with higher taxes, an iffy proposition. Trump talks as if the constitutional division of powers doesn\u2019t exist, ignoring not only Congress but at times the courts \u2014 not to mention international norms \u2014 in vowing to restore the illegal interrogation practice of waterboarding, rip up trade agreements and more.</p>", "<p>Neither candidate is easy to pigeonhole on policy, apart from the fact that Clinton is clearly more liberal.</p>", "<p>Trump departs from Republican tenets in his vow to protect entitlement programs such as Social Security, shrink from foreign entanglements and open spending spigots in other areas, like child care and college costs, where conservatives think austerity should be exercised.</p>", "<p>He\u2019s not a tidy conservative by any means, nor even consistent with himself, having reshaped central planks of his platform during the campaign. The multiple variations of his proposed restrictions on Muslim entry into the United States have left obscured what he truly intends to do.</p>", "<p>Clinton has a Senate voting record and a deep stack of policy papers. But the hacked campaign emails made public by WikiLeaks reinforce what has long been thought about her \u2014 that how she leads might be driven more by political calculation than conviction. She had a friendly message to Wall Street in handsomely paid, private speeches that she refused to release on her own, and a harsher one tailored for campaign consumption.</p>", "<p>Trump\u2019s supporters may agree with him that this is not the time to sweat the details, but as president he would owe the country truly secure borders. He owes the country an influx of jobs to replace those that left the country. He, like Clinton, would be judged on whether he makes good on starting up super-expensive promises to repair roads, bridges and other infrastructure.</p>", "<p>Among Clinton\u2019s IOUs: Government-paid in-state tuition at public colleges and universities for students from families earning less than $125,000 a year. A commitment for the United States to generate enough renewable energy to power every home within 10 years. A national minimum wage of $12 or more, up from $7.25. Twelve weeks of government-paid family and medical leave, guaranteeing workers two-thirds of their wages up to a certain amount.</p>", "<p>Here is a quick, alphabetical look at the numerous policy differences between Clinton and Trump:</p>", "<p>Trump, in the third and final presidential debate, said he would appoint justices open to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. Clinton vowed to appoint justices who would uphold that ruling, saying, \u201cWe have come too far to have that turned back now.\u201d</p>", "<p>Clinton wants a 12-week government-paid family- and medical-leave program, guaranteeing workers two-thirds of their wages up to a certain amount. Trump proposes six weeks of leave for new mothers, with the government paying wages equivalent to unemployment benefits.</p>", "<p>Both candidates propose tax relief for child-care costs. Trump\u2019s plan provides for a new income-tax deduction for child-care expenses, other tax benefits and a new rebate or tax credit for low-income families. Clinton says no family should spend more than 10 percent of its income on child care. She would double the child tax credit for families with children 4 and younger, to $2,000 per child.</p>", "<p>Tensions have been rising over China\u2019s assertive behavior in the seas of Asia. The United States also accuses China of unfair trading practices and cyber theft of business secrets.</p>", "<p>Trump says that the sheer volume of trade gives the United States leverage over China. He accuses China of undervaluing its currency to make its exports artificially cheap and proposes tariffs as high as 45 percent on Chinese imports if Beijing doesn\u2019t change its behavior. Such action could risk a trade war that would make many products in the United States more expensive.</p>", "<p>Clinton says Washington needs to press the rising Asian power to play by international rules, whether on trade or territorial disputes.</p>", "<p>While many of China\u2019s neighbors are unnerved by its military buildup, the wider world needs the United States and China to get along, to tackle global problems. The United States and China are also economically interdependent, and punishment by one party could end up hurting the other.</p>", "<p>Clinton says climate change threatens us all, while Trump repeatedly tweets that global warming is a hoax.</p>", "<p>From May 2015 to August 2016, 16 months in a row set records globally for heat, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>", "<p>Scientists have connected man-made climate change to deadly heat waves, droughts and flood-inducing downpours. Studies say climate change is raising sea levels, melting ice and killing coral. It\u2019s making people sicker with asthma and allergies and may eventually shrink our bank accounts.</p>", "<p>Trump calls attempts to remedy global warming \u201cjust a very, very expensive form of tax.\u201d</p>", "<p>Clinton proposes to spend $60 billion to switch from dirty fossil fuels to cleaner energy. She promises to deliver on President Obama\u2019s pledge that by 2025, the United States will be emitting 30 percent less heat-trapping gases than in 2005.</p>", "<p>The federal government is borrowing about one out of seven dollars it spends and steadily piling up debt \u2014 to the tune of about $14 trillion held by investors.</p>", "<p>Most economists say rising debt risks crowding out investment and forcing interest rates up, among other problems. At the same time, rapidly growing spending on federal health-care programs like Medicare and the drain on Social Security balances caused by the rising tide of baby boomers could squeeze out other spending, on roads, education, the armed forces and more.</p>", "<p>It takes spending cuts, tax increases or both to dent the deficit. Lawmakers, instead, prefer higher spending and tax cuts.</p>", "<p>Neither Clinton nor Trump has focused on the debt.</p>", "<p>Trump has promised massive tax cuts that would drive up the debt and he\u2019s shown no interest in curbing expensive benefit programs like Medicare.</p>", "<p>Clinton, by contrast, is proposing tax increases on the wealthy. But she wouldn\u2019t use the money to bring down the debt. Instead, she\u2019d turn around and spend it on college-tuition subsidies, infrastructure and health care.</p>", "<p>Clinton wants to make preschool universal for all 4-year-old children within 10 years by providing new federal dollars to states. Trump proposes to spend $20 billion during his first year in office to help states expand school-choice programs. He wants states to divert an additional $110 billion of their own education money to help parents who want their children to go to other schools.</p>", "<p>Domestic production of all types of energy except coal has boomed in recent years, spurred by improved drilling techniques such as fracking and discoveries of vast oil supplies in North Dakota and natural gas in states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and West Virginia.</p>", "<p>Clinton vows to continue the boom while ensuring the United States generates enough renewable energy to power every home in America within 10 years.</p>", "<p>Trump vows to \u201cunleash American energy,\u201d allowing unfettered production of oil, coal, natural gas and other sources to push the United States toward energy independence and create jobs.</p>", "<p>Both Clinton and Trump support natural gas, a cleaner alternative to coal. Trump calls for rescinding the Clean Power Plan, a key element of Obama\u2019s strategy to fight climate change. Clinton is committed to Obama\u2019s climate-change goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by up to 30 percent by 2025.</p>", "<p>Do Americans have the right to have AR-style firearms, the long guns with a military look used in the past year in several mass shootings? Should they be able to buy magazines that hold 10 or more bullets? Should every gun buyer have to pass a background check?</p>", "<p>Trump casts himself as an ardent protector of gun rights and proclaims that if more \u201cgood guys\u201d were armed there would be fewer gun tragedies. He\u2019s made fealty to the Second Amendment a quality he wants in Supreme Court nominees.</p>", "<p>Clinton wants to renew an expired ban on assault-type weapons instituted when her husband was president. She\u2019s also called for measures to ensure background checks are completed before a gun sale goes forward, mandating such checks for gun-show sales and repealing a law that shields gun manufacturers from liability.</p>", "<p>Millions of people previously shut out have been covered by Obama\u2019s health-care law. No one can be denied coverage anymore because of a pre-existing condition. But \u201cObamacare\u201d remains divisive, and premiums for next year are rising sharply in many communities. As well, some major insurers are leaving the program.</p>", "<p>Whether Americans would be better off trading for a GOP plan is another question. Recent studies found Trump\u2019s proposal would make 18 million to 20 million people uninsured. GOP congressional leaders have a more comprehensive approach, but key details are still missing.</p>", "<p>Overall health-care spending is trending higher again, and prices for prescription drugs \u2014 new and old \u2014 are a major worry.</p>", "<p>Medicare\u2019s insolvency date has moved up by two years \u2014 to 2028.</p>", "<p>Clinton would stay the course, adjusting as needed. Republicans are united on repealing Obama\u2019s law, but it\u2019s unclear how they would replace it.</p>", "<p>Radical Islamic extremism has inspired a series of deadly attacks on U.S. soil, shaking the American psyche and leaving the presidential contenders at odds over how to respond.</p>", "<p>Trump has proposed various means of choking off a terrorist influx, though that would do little to stop self-radicalized Americans.</p>", "<p>Clinton says that Muslim Americans help the struggle against homegrown extremism because they can prevent young people from joining jihadis and notify authorities when they suspect radicalization.</p>", "<p>She\u2019d prohibit people on terrorist watch lists from being able to buy weapons.</p>", "<p>Trump at first pledged to deport the estimated 11\u2009million immigrants in the country illegally. Not only that, he\u2019d build a wall along the Mexican border. But his position has evolved. He\u2019s sticking to his vow to build the wall and make Mexico pay. But he\u2019s no longer proposing to deport people who have not committed crimes beyond their immigration offenses. Still, he\u2019s not proposing a way for people living in the country illegally to gain legal status.</p>", "<p>Clinton, in contrast, would overhaul immigration laws to include a path to citizenship, not just legal status.</p>", "<p>Illegal immigration has been at nearly 40-year lows for several years. It even appears that Mexican migration trends have reversed, with more Mexicans leaving the United States than arriving. Billions of dollars have been spent in recent years to build fencing, improve border technology and expand the Border Patrol.</p>", "<p>Income inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 percent of households climbed 7.7 percent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 percent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768.</p>", "<p>Clinton has highlighted inequality in multiple speeches. She hopes to redirect more money to the middle class and impoverished. Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy, increase the federal minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, provide universal prekindergarten and offer the prospect of tuition-free college.</p>", "<p>Trump offers a blunter message about a system \u201crigged\u201d against average Americans. To bring back jobs, Trump has promised new trade deals with better terms, greater infrastructure spending than Clinton foresees and tax cuts that he says would propel stronger growth (though independent analysts say his budget plans would raise deficits).</p>", "<p>A recent report by the American Society of Civil Engineers projects the United States will face a $1.4\u2009trillion funding gap for its infrastructure by 2025.</p>", "<p>Clinton wants to spend $250 billion over the next five years on public infrastructure and direct an additional $25 billion to a new infrastructure bank to help finance local projects. Trump has said he wants to spend at least double that amount on infrastructure, financed with bonds. Whoever becomes president, it\u2019s a staggering amount of money for the federal treasury to put out \u2014 if Congress goes along.</p>", "<p>Last year\u2019s nuclear deal with Tehran has significantly reduced for now the threat of a U.S.-Iranian military confrontation. The accord curtailed Iran\u2019s nuclear program, pulling it back from atomic-weapons capability in exchange for the end of many economic sanctions.</p>", "<p>As secretary of state, Clinton helped lay the groundwork for the pact. She supports it, while taking a generally tougher tone on Iran than Obama.</p>", "<p>Trump contends that he can renegotiate its terms.</p>", "<p>Both are prepared to use force to prevent Tehran from acquiring the bomb. If the deal collapses or expires without sufficient safeguards, that possibility is back in play.</p>", "<p>The Islamic State group (ISIS) seized swaths of land in Iraq and expanded its territory in Syria in a dramatic blitz in 2014.</p>", "<p>Clinton\u2019s plan to deal with the ISIS threat abroad and at home mostly embraces what Obama is doing. Trump has vowed relentless bombing and expressed support for enhanced interrogation techniques.</p>", "<p>Tepid income growth and a smaller share of the population at work have kept many Americans anxious about jobs and the economy, seven years after the Great Recession ended.</p>", "<p>And most jobs that pay decent wages require more education than in the past, leaving many workers feeling left behind.</p>", "<p>Trump says he would cut regulations and taxes to spur more hiring, and renegotiate or withdraw from trade agreements to bring jobs back to the United States.</p>", "<p>Clinton says she would spend more on roads, tunnels and other infrastructure and make state colleges and universities tuition free to most students.</p>", "<p>Same-sex marriage is now the law of the land, but there are other battlegrounds related to civil rights and nondiscrimination protections for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people. Two polarizing questions: What sort of access should transgender people have to public bathrooms? And are the advances for LGBT rights infringing on the religious freedom of some Americans?</p>", "<p>Clinton would probably press efforts to bolster transgender rights.</p>", "<p>Thus far, federal judges have generally been unsympathetic to arguments that certain types of anti-LGBT discrimination are permissible if in accordance with a person\u2019s religious beliefs. Trump has told conservatives he\u2019d place a high priority on religious liberty.</p>", "<p>Clinton supports raising the minimum wage at least to $12 an hour, even higher at state and local levels. Trump has said he supports an increase to $10 but thinks states should \u201creally call the shots.\u201d It\u2019s $7.25 now.</p>", "<p>The typical household\u2019s income has fallen 2.4 percent since 1999. Low-paying industries, such as retail, fast food and home health-care aides, are among the largest and fastest-growing. And many low-wage workers are older, have families and are probably more willing to demand higher pay.</p>", "<p>Trump says the United States can put more pressure on China to rein in its North Korean ally. He says he is willing to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.</p>", "<p>Clinton wants the world to intensify sanctions against North Korea, as the Obama administration did with Iran, a course that eventually opened the way for a deal to contain its nuclear program.</p>", "<p>More than 28,000 Americans died from overdosing on opioids in 2014, a record high for the nation.</p>", "<p>A rise in prescription painkillers is partially to blame: The sale of these drugs has quadrupled since 1999, and so has the number of Americans dying from an addiction to them. When prescriptions run out, people find themselves turning to the cheaper alternative, heroin, and, increasingly, the even more deadly drug, fentanyl.</p>", "<p>Trump says the wall he wants to build along the southern border is essential to stopping the flow of illegal drugs into the country. Clinton pledges to spend $10\u2009billion to increase access to prevention, treatment and recovery services, among other things.</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>", "<p>Since the death in 2014 of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., the sharing of video-recorded deaths of African Americans at the hands of law enforcement has sparked unrest in many cities around the country and prompted calls for additional training and more monitoring of police forces.</p>", "<p>Clinton has offered specific proposals, including legislation that would help end racial profiling, providing federal matching funds for more police body cameras and overhauling mandatory minimum sentencing.</p>", "<p>Trump has described himself as the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate and has not specifically addressed plans on race and policing. He endorsed a former New York City police policy called \u201cstop and frisk\u201d after unrest in Charlotte, N.C., over the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott.</p>", "<p>With millions of Syrians displaced by a yearslong war and hundreds of thousands of people fleeing to Europe, countries around the world are being pressed to help resettle people seeking refuge.</p>", "<p>The United States pledged to accept 10,000 such refugees by the end of the budget year in September and did so, a month early.</p>", "<p>Republicans have balked at the idea of allowing people from Syria into the United States, and Trump has called for a halt on refugee resettlement for them. He says vetting of these refugees is inadequate.</p>", "<p>Clinton has pledged to expand the Syrian refugee program and allow as many as 65,000 such refugees into the United States.</p>", "<p>Trump favors cutting regulation and has promised massive tax cuts, but his plans are expected to add trillions to the national debt. Unlike most conservatives, he supports eminent domain and has spoken positively about government-run health care. Clinton has vowed new spending on education and infrastructure that could grow government, and strongly supports \u201cObamacare.\u201d</p>", "<p>Polls have found Americans generally feel frustrated by the federal government and think it\u2019s wasteful. A smaller government sounds good to a lot of people until they\u2019re asked what specific services or benefits they are willing to do without.</p>", "<p>Russia is reasserting itself, posing vexing questions for the U.S. and presidential candidates split on Vladimir Putin. It\u2019s also apparently poking its nose into the election \u2014 blamed by the United States for hacking Democratic Party emails.</p>", "<p>Russia is militarily involved in Syria and supports separatists in eastern Ukraine and areas of Georgia. At the same time, the United States has been forced to accept that working with Russia is probably the only way to achieve results on many complicated international issues. Thus, Russia was central in the Iran nuclear negotiations and is a player as well as negotiator in the Syria truce effort.</p>", "<p>Trump advocates improved relations with Russia and has been strikingly complimentary of Putin\u2019s authoritarian leadership style.</p>", "<p>Clinton has had direct negotiating experience with Putin and his aides and that has left her wary of cooperating with Moscow. She promises to stand up to Putin and deter Russian aggression in Europe.</p>", "<p>The trustees who oversee the program say it has enough money to pay full benefits until 2034. But at that point, Social Security will collect only enough taxes to pay 79 percent of benefits. Unless Congress acts, millions of people on fixed incomes would get an automatic 21 percent cut in benefits.</p>", "<p>Clinton has proposed expanding Social Security benefits for widows and family caregivers. She says she would preserve Social Security by requiring \u201cthe wealthiest\u201d to pay Social Security taxes on more of their income. Trump has promised not to cut Social Security. He\u2019s suggested he\u2019d revisit the program after his tax-cut plan boosts economic growth.</p>", "<p>Student debt now totals around $1.26 trillion. Out of the 43 million Americans with student debt, roughly 16 percent are in long-term default \u2014 a potential hit in excess of $100 billion that taxpayers would absorb.</p>", "<p>Clinton proposes no tuition for students from families making less than $85,000 who go to an in-state, public college. That threshold would rise to $125,000 by 2021. Trump promises to cap payments at 12.5 percent of a borrower\u2019s income, with loan forgiveness if they make payments for 15 years.</p>", "<p>The court has been operating with eight justices since Antonin Scalia died in February. The court is split between four Democratic-appointed, liberal justices and four conservatives who were appointed by Republicans \u2014 although Justice Anthony Kennedy has sided with the liberals on abortion, same-sex marriage and affirmative action in the past two years.</p>", "<p>The ninth justice will push the court left or right, depending on whether Clinton or Trump becomes president. Obama has nominated Merrick Garland to take Scalia\u2019s seat, but the Republican Senate has refused to consider Garland\u2019s nomination, in an effort to prevent a liberal court majority.</p>", "<p>Trump is intent on cutting taxes. He\u2019d collapse the current seven income-tax brackets, which peak at 39.6 percent, into just three tiers with a top rate of 33 percent, slice the corporate income tax and eliminate the estate tax. Analysts say the wealthy would benefit disproportionately.</p>", "<p>Clinton is proposing tax increases on the rich, including a minimum 30 percent tax on incomes over $1 million and higher taxes on big inheritances. Most taxpayers would see little or no impact on their tax bill, but the government might look different. She\u2019d use the added revenue to expand domestic programs.</p>", "<p>Many American voters are skeptical about free trade \u2014 or hostile to it. The backlash threatens a pillar of U.S. policy: The United States has long sought global trade. Economists say imports cut prices for consumers and make the United States more efficient. But unease has simmered, especially as American workers faced competition from low-wage Chinese labor. Last year, the United States ran a $334\u2009billion trade deficit with China \u2014 $500 billion with the entire world.</p>", "<p>Clinton broke with Obama by opposing an Asia-Pacific trade agreement that she had supported as secretary of state.</p>", "<p>Trump vows to tear up existing trade deals and to slap huge tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>", "<p>But trade deals have far less impact on jobs than forces such as automation and wage differences between countries. Trump\u2019s plans to impose tariffs could start a trade war and raise prices.</p>", "<p>Clinton has pledged to ensure veterans have access to timely and high-quality health care and vows to block efforts to privatize the Veterans Health Administration, the VA\u2019s health-care arm. Clinton also wants to bolster veterans\u2019 benefits, including education and housing aid included in the GI bill. She would ensure that military sexual trauma is acknowledged as a disability under VA rules.</p>", "<p>Trump says he will expand programs that allow veterans to choose their doctor \u2014 regardless of whether they\u2019re affiliated with the VA \u2014 and still receive government-paid medical care. Trump says that\u2019s not privatized care but, he told The Associated Press, \u201ca way of not allowing people to die waiting for doctors.\u201d</p>", "<p>Trump also pledged to fire or discipline VA employees who fail veterans or breach the public trust. He also would increase mental-health professionals and create a \u201cWhite House hotline\u201d dedicated to veterans. If a valid complaint is not addressed, \u201cI will pick up the phone and fix it myself if I have to,\u201d Trump said.</p>", "<p>Republican-controlled legislatures are tightening voter laws, placing limits on early voting and same-day registration, and imposing new requirements for IDs at polling places. In 2013, the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. That provision had required states with a history of racial discrimination to get federal pre-clearance to change election laws.</p>", "<p>The issue has become highly partisan with the rapid growth of minority populations, which in recent presidential elections have tilted heavily Democratic. And it has become overlaid with Trump\u2019s statements that the election is rigged against him and that he might not accept defeat at the polls.</p>", "<p>The Obama Justice Department has challenged voter ID and other laws, saying they could restrict access for minorities and young people. Federal court rulings softened some of the toughest restrictions, but litigation remains knotted up with Supreme Court appeals under way. Bills in Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act are stalled.</p>", "<p>Trump opposes same-day voter registration. Clinton wants Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act and seeks a national standard of at least 20 days of early in-person voting.</p>", "<p>The debate over rules governing banks and the markets comes down to this: how to prevent another economic catastrophe like the Great Recession ignited by the financial crisis in 2008. The worst upheaval since the 1930s Depression wiped out $11 trillion in U.S. household wealth and about 8 million jobs. More than 5 million families lost their homes to foreclosure.</p>", "<p>The economic recovery over eight years has been halting and slow.</p>", "<p>The goal behind the most radical overhaul of financial rules since the 1930s was to rein in high-risk practices on Wall Street and prevent another multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout of banks. In the package of rules Congress enacted in 2010, regulators gained new tools to shut banks without resorting to bailouts. Risky lending was restricted, and a new federal agency was charged with protecting consumers from deceptive marketing of financial products.</p>", "<p>Republicans and many in the business community say the restrictions have raised costs for banks, especially smaller ones. They want the overhaul law repealed. Trump calls it a \u201cdisaster,\u201d saying he would dismantle most of it.</p>", "<p>Clinton says the financial rules should be preserved and strengthened.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p>UK banker pleads not guilty to murder in Hong Kong trial</p>", "<p>Average gasoline price down 4 cents to $2.25 a gallon</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      The ABCs of where Clinton, Trump stand on the issues      "]}

A president punishing a political challenger as if this were a two-bit dictatorship would make the country much, much worse.</p>", "<p>Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email system for sensitive business while secretary of state showed poor judgment and probably cost her the presidency. But it was not an offense worthy of prosecution or jail.</p>", "<p>As we\u2019re all painfully aware at this point, the FBI repeatedly went through Clinton\u2019s email trove and found nothing that warranted criminal charges.</p>", "<p>In a July decision that was reiterated on Nov. 6, Republican <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"content-link external\">FBI Director James Comey said,</a> \u201cOur judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case\u201d and \u201cno charges are appropriate in this case.\u201d</p>", "<p>That should help Trump decide whether to appoint his snarling <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/08/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-says-there-were-no-domestic-attacks-durin/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"content-link external\">pit bull</a> Rudy Giuliani to serve as attorney general.</p>", "<p>Giuliani last week hinted that prosecuting Clinton is a possibility,<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/giuliani-hannity-230726\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"content-link external\"> accused her and Obama of corruption </a>and equated the situation with <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/presidential-pardons-how-the-nixon-pardon-strained-a-presidential-friendshi\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"content-link external\">Watergate</a>.

His sentence was commuted by outgoing President George W.

California alone accounts for almost 10 percent of the approximately 160 ballot measures spread over 35 states. Here are a few to keep an eye on.</p>", "<p><strong>GUNS</strong>: In addition to Washington voters being asked to allow families or authorities to get a court order to restrict gun access when a person exhibits mental illness or indicates they may harm themselves or other people, Nevada and Maine have proposals that would eliminate the so-called gun-show loophole by requiring federal background checks on firearm sales between private parties \u2014 including those at gun shows. California will decide whether background checks must be completed on large-capacity ammunition magazines. It would also require most ammunition sales be made through licensed vendors and reported to the Department of Justice.</p>", "<p><strong>MINIMUM WAGE</strong>: Voters in Arizona, Colorado and Maine, as well as Washington, will decide whether to increase the minimum wage. In Colorado, Arizona and Maine, it would increase to $12 an hour. Washington will consider a $13.75-an-hour minimum wage. With the exception of Maine, the full increase would be in effect by 2020. South Dakota, however, is seeking to reduce its minimum wage for workers under 18 from $8.55 to $7.25 an hour.</p>", "<p><strong>DEATH PENALTY</strong>: California has two death-penalty measures on the ballot: Proposition 62 seeks to repeal capital punishment, and retroactively apply to all prisoners now on death row. Proposition 66 would place a five-year limit on the appeals process for a person sentenced to death, and initial appeals would be handled by trial courts. Because the measures offer opposite solutions, if both were to pass, the one with the highest vote total would become law. Nebraska voters will be asked to to reinstate the death penalty, which lawmakers banned last year. Oklahoma voters will decide on amending the state constitution to carry out the death penalty by other means if one method is deemed invalid \u2014 as occurred in Nebraska when its sole means of execution, the electric chair, was ruled as cruel and unusual punishment by the state\u2019s Supreme Court. Capital punishment is the law in 30 states.</p>", "<p><strong>OTHER ISSUES: </strong>Voters in Colorado will choose whether to remove slavery from its constitution. The state\u2019s constitution now allows for slavery as punishment for a crime. The ballot measure would eliminate slavery as an option. In California, voters will decide whether adult-film stars should be required to wear condoms during the filming of sex scenes. The measure would also require film producers to pay for medical tests related to sexually transmitted diseases.</p>", "<p><em>Los Angeles Times</em></p>", "<p>Forty-six percent of Hispanics said the drug should be legal, while 49 percent said it should remain illegal, the poll found. By comparison, big majorities of both black and white voters \u2014 59 percent \u2014 said it was time to end the federal prohibition on marijuana.</p>", "<p>\u201cLatinos could determine who moves into the White House \u2014 and they may also be the deciding votes in either direction on the marijuana initiatives,\u201d said Sarah Trumble, deputy director of social policy for Third Way, a public policy think tank in Washington, D.C.</p>", "<p>Part of it is generational, with older traditional, conservative Latinos who associate marijuana with crime and addiction, opposing legalization, with younger Latinos tending to favor it. </p>", "<p>Four of the nine states voting on marijuana-legalization measures have large and growing Hispanic populations: Florida, California, Nevada and Arizona. In Florida, for example, Hispanics strongly favor Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, over Republican Donald Trump, and they make up more than 15 percent of the state\u2019s voters.</p>", "<p>\u201cHow they vote on marijuana will have a major impact \u2014 not only in Florida, California, Nevada and Arizona tomorrow \u2014 but also on future policy and public opinion, given the demographic shifts the nation is undergoing,\u201d Trumble said.</p>", "<p>Pot backers hope that 2016 will mark a turning point in their long drive to legalize the drug. If the votes go their way, nearly 25 percent of the U.S. population could live in states with legalized recreational marijuana.</p>", "<p>\u201cThese ballot measures are all big steps forward for the marijuana-policy reform movement regardless of their outcome on Election Day,\u201d said Mason Tvert, communications director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project. He said the national debate had shifted \u201cfrom whether marijuana should be legalized to how it can best be regulated and taxed.\u201d</p>", "<p>President Obama jumped into the debate last Friday, saying the federal government will likely have to rethink its ban on marijuana if the legalization measures pass Tuesday.</p>", "<p>In an interview with Bill Maher on HBO, Obama said the Justice Department, FBI and drug-enforcement agents would have a hard time figuring out \u201chow they\u2019re supposed to enforce laws in some places and not in others,\u201d particularly if state voters decide to legalize the drug through the entire Pacific corridor.</p>", "<p>\u201cThat is not going to be tenable,\u201d said Obama, who has opposed federal marijuana legalization but has allowed states to sell and tax the drug.</p>", "<p>The most-watched votes Tuesday will be in five states \u2014 California, Arizona, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine \u2014 that will decide whether to fully legalize and regulate pot. They would join four states that already allow using the drug for recreational purposes: Washington, Colorado, Alaska and Oregon.</p>", "<p>Voters in Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas will decide whether to approve marijuana for medical use, while Montana residents will vote on whether to loosen restrictions on the state\u2019s medical-marijuana laws. Twenty-five states have already approved medical marijuana.</p>", "<p>California, the first state to approve medical marijuana, in 1996, represents the biggest prize for legalization backers.</p>", "<p>On Friday, Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco told the Los Angeles Times that she plans to vote for legalization. She\u2019s at odds with Democratic California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who opposes it.</p>", "<p>Trumble said female voters would be another group that could be key in determining the outcome of the nine ballot measures.</p>", "<p>While a large number of female voters could help Clinton, Trumble said polls had found that women were less likely to back legalization than men, particularly older women and Republican women.</p>", "<p>\u201cHow many women \u2014 and of what age and political persuasion \u2014 the Clinton turnout effort delivers is likely to be key,\u201d Trumble said.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p>2 bodies with apparent gunshot wounds found at fire scene</p>", "<p>Coroner: 3rd body found on property of South Carolina man linked to 7 deaths, woman who was chained in storage container</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Pro-Clinton Latino surge could hurt marijuana-legalization push      "]}

But she\u2019s also a realist. Nobody plays at that level without getting a little dirty,\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never held that against her \u2026 and people have this perception that she\u2019s much dirtier than she is.\u201d</p>", "<p>He\u2019d have a hard time convincing Susan Jacobs, a lighting designer from West Seattle. She can recite a long list of things she doesn\u2019t like about Clinton \u2014 from her support of the fracking industry to her past position opposing gay marriage.</p>", "<p>While she has a very low opinion of Donald Trump, Jacobs doesn\u2019t feel Clinton is that much better. \u201cThis is our choice \u2014 Trump or Hillary? That\u2019s absurd,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for the person who most aligns with my values, and that\u2019s Jill Stein.\u201d</p>", "<p>Jacob, who contributed to Sanders, hasn\u2019t given to Stein yet. But she\u2019s considering it.</p>", "<p>Just eight Seattleites who gave money to Sanders have donated to Donald Trump. I managed to track one of them down.</p>", "<p>I told him he was one of eight. \u201cIt makes me kind of interesting,\u201d he replied.</p>", "<p>A tech worker who lives in Belltown, he would only talk to me if his name wasn\u2019t used, saying he was afraid of repercussions at his workplace. Though he calls his feelings about Trump \u201ccomplicated,\u201d he sent him money because \u201c \u2026 he is the only credible outsider at this time.\u201d</p>", "<p>Even so, he might vote for Gary Johnson. the Libertarian candidate, or Stein. The one thing he\u2019s sure of is that he won\u2019t vote for Clinton. \u201cHillary is part of an insider group that\u2019s getting bigger and bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a real threat.\u201d</p>", "<p>One caveat: The data on candidate contributions present only a partial picture.

Majorities of voters say she has the temperament for the job and the steadier hand on foreign policy. Only 36 percent of them, however, view her as an agent of change. That perception worries some Clinton campaign advisers, who want the race to hinge on Trump\u2019s character rather than voters\u2019 desire to upend the status quo.</p>", "<p>With fewer than eight weeks until Election Day, the two candidates are locked in a close contest in which the challenge from third-party candidates may make a difference. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has the support of 46 percent of likely voters nationwide, compared with 44 percent for Trump, the Republican; that result includes voters who said they were leaning toward a candidate.</p>", "<p>Looking more broadly at all registered voters, Clinton holds a wider edge, 46 to 41 percent, driven by her support among women, minorities and college graduates. Getting those registered but unlikely voters to the polls in November is a large challenge for Clinton\u2019s campaign.</p>", "<p>Trump has an advantage among men, whites and less-educated voters.</p>", "<p>In a four-way race, Trump and Clinton are tied at 42 percent each. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, has the support of 8 percent of likely voters, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, takes 4 percent. Johnson is hoping to qualify for the coming presidential debates, but he is short of the requirement of reaching 15 percent support in an average of major polls.</p>", "<p>Among voters younger than 30, Clinton\u2019s support drops 10 points in a four-way race. Their support for Trump falls 7 points, but he is not relying on young voters as much.</p>", "<p>The race has clearly grown tighter in recent weeks. National polling averages show that Clinton\u2019s margin over Trump has narrowed from 8 points in early August to 2 points today.</p>", "<p>Polls in a number of key swing states also have narrowed in the past week. Trump leads in polling averages in Ohio and Florida, for example, reversing leads that Clinton held for months. Projections of Clinton\u2019s Electoral College advantage have also shown a tightening based on recent polls.</p>", "<p>Voters expressed discontent with both candidates. Among those who say they intend to vote for Trump or Clinton, slightly more than half express strong support. The rest say that they harbor reservations about their candidate or that they are voting simply to thwart the other nominee.</p>", "<p>Despite voters\u2019 misgivings, the major-party nominees are consolidating support among their party faithful. Clinton commands support of 87 percent of Democrats, while Trump is supported by 85 percent of Republicans.</p>", "<p>The poll results offer more cause for concern than confidence for Trump and Clinton as they prepare for their first debate, on Sept. 26, and as early voting begins in some states next weekend. Their favorability ratings remain low, with only about one-third of voters seeing each of them positively, despite the candidates\u2019 attempts to use their conventions, commercials and public appearances to persuade voters to see them in a new light.</p>", "<p>A majority of voters say Trump does not care about the needs or problems of Hispanics; most voters see Clinton as caring about Hispanics, and a majority of voters agree with her view that most immigrants living in the country illegally should be allowed to stay and eventually apply for citizenship.</p>", "<p>The nationwide telephone poll was conducted with 1,433 registered voters from Sept. 9-13 on cellphones and landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for all voters.</p>", "<p>Trump\u2019s temperament stands out as potentially his most damaging vulnerability, as his penchant for insults and provocations often undercuts his political message. Trump advisers see the televised debates as his greatest opportunity to reassure people about his personality, but he starts in a weak position, with 64 percent of voters saying he does not have the right temperament to be president.</p>", "<p>Sixty-seven percent of voters see Trump as a risky choice for president, compared with 51 percent who hold that view about Clinton, a surprising number in itself given that she has been a president\u2019s spouse, a senator and a secretary of state.</p>", "<p>For Trump advisers, the image of Trump as a gamble comes with an upside. They concede he is most likely to lose the election if a majority of voters view him as dangerous or reckless. But if he can persuade people to see him simply as unpredictable \u2014 even cagey in a strategic sense \u2014 and committed to disrupting the federal government, voters could regard him as worth taking a chance on for four years while looking to his advisers and Congress as a check on his power.</p>", "<p>Several Trump supporters said in follow-up interviews that they believed he was worth the risk, given the economic and security challenges facing the nation. Forty-eight percent of voters think Trump could bring real change to Washington, a 12-point edge over Clinton; another 48 percent think he could not bring change.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe risky part with Trump is the fact of his rhetoric, how he says things,\u201d said Patrick Kellegher, 52, a political independent and a retired deputy sheriff from Anaconda, Mont. \u201cBut I think he is outside the known government circles.\u201d He added, \u201cI think Trump will bring about real change because he\u2019s looking at it through a different scope.\u201d</p>", "<p>The candidates also face continued doubts about their honesty. Of the two, Clinton has tried more visibly to address misgivings about her trustworthiness, by releasing decades of tax returns and more details about her health than Trump has. Yet one stain on her reputation is proving indelible: About 7 in 10 voters say she did something wrong when she used a private email server as secretary of state, including 45 percent who say she did something illegal.</p>", "<p>Trump has yet to release any of his tax returns, a break with political tradition that goes back decades, and has been far less specific than Clinton on many personal and political questions, including his policy proposals. Asked if it was necessary for Trump to release his tax returns, 59 percent of voters said it was. Forty-five percent of voters said they would like the candidates to release more medical records.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Tight race for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, poll shows      "]}

The funding was powered by a surge of six-figure contributions raised by Clinton from the likes of James Cameron, the Hollywood director, and George Soros, the retired hedge-fund manager, and several members of the billionaire Pritzker family.</p>", "<p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) has provided the states with just $11 million, limited by Trump\u2019s difficulties in persuading the traditional Republican big-donor base to invest in his campaign.</p>", "<p>\u201cIn many ways, we are kind of used to the concept of building our own empire,\u201d said Matt Borges, executive director of the Republican Party of Ohio, adding that he did not believe Ohio Republicans would be at a disadvantage come Election Day. \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever I can get.\u201d</p>", "<p>More than two-thirds of the Democrats\u2019 cash went to a dozen presidential battlegrounds critical to any Clinton victory. The biggest beneficiaries were Florida, which has taken in close to $3.5 million, and Pennsylvania and Ohio, which have each received more than $2 million.</p>", "<p>In each of those states, the funds from the national party have made a difference, erasing deficits in federal contributions against the respective Republican state parties.</p>", "<p>The money followed a legal but circuitous route turbocharged by the 2014 ruling in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, which struck down Watergate-era limits on the combined amount one person could donate to all federal candidates and parties in an election cycle.</p>", "<p>Like other candidates for federal office this year, Clinton can accept only up to $5,400 from any one donor over the course of her campaign. But after the McCutcheon decision, Clinton established an agreement last year with the Democratic Party under which she asked her wealthiest patrons to write checks in excess of $300,000, more than double the old limit, to the Hillary Victory Fund, an account made up of the national and state parties and the Clinton campaign.</p>", "<p>That amount is a lump sum equal to the total contributions each donor is allowed to give to her campaign and the DNC, along with $10,000 to each of the 38 state party organizations now participating in the arrangements.</p>", "<p>Because there are no limits on how much money party committees can transfer to one another, most of the state parties have cycled their share back to the DNC. The party then moved the cash into a smaller number of battleground states to prepare for Election Day. The effect is a legal end-run around contribution limits, allowing wealthy donors to give far more than $5,400 to help Clinton where she needs it the most.</p>", "<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a party leader or a candidate who can attract big enough donors, it means contribution limits are for the little guy,\u201d said Ian Vandewalker, a counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, which favors tighter controls on political money. \u201cThe party leaders, the candidates who have a national name, significant amounts of their war chests are built from these big checks,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>The Democrats\u2019 unexpected advantage comes courtesy of a lawsuit filed in 2012 by the RNC and Shaun McCutcheon, an Alabama businessman.</p>", "<p>While both parties have used joint fundraising arrangements for years, the decision issued two years ago in the McCutcheon case made it easier to raise and concentrate even more money from the same small group of wealthy donors.</p>", "<p>At the time, the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority rejected concerns that lifting the limit would make candidates more indebted to the biggest donors. During oral arguments, Justice Samuel Alito Jr. dismissed the idea that party leaders or candidates in different states would cooperate by sending their contributions elsewhere as \u201cwild hypotheticals.\u201d</p>", "<p>Democrats also castigated the court, arguing that it had paved the way for the wealthiest donors to further dominate campaign giving.</p>", "<p>\u201cWith the rate the Supreme Court is going, there will only be three or four people in the whole country that have to finance our entire political system,\u201d Clinton said during an appearance in Oregon the week after the McCutcheon decision.</p>", "<p>Clinton was no doubt exaggerating for effect. Still, the real numbers are striking: Just 250 donors have accounted for about $44 million in contributions to the Hillary Victory Fund during the past year.</p>", "<p>Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said Clinton continued to support new restrictions on campaign money, but the only way to achieve them was to elect more Democrats who shared her views.</p>", "<p>\u201cHillary Clinton has fought for campaign-finance reform her entire career and, as president, will make it a priority to restore the role of everyday voters in elections,\u201d Schwerin said, \u201cbut the stakes of this election are too high to unilaterally disarm.\u201d</p>", "<p>By contrast, the money raised by Trump and the Republicans, while robust, has been driven chiefly by small checks from his grass-roots supporters.</p>", "<p>The Republicans also have not been as shrewd at maximizing whatever money Trump\u2019s large-dollar fundraisers have contributed. More of the Republican big-donor money is being directed into national party accounts that cannot be spent directly on the election.</p>", "<p>And the committee for Trump Victory \u2014 the collective account set up to receive big contributions for the state, national and Trump campaigns \u2014 had shared virtually no cash with the state parties through June. A Republican spokeswoman declined to explain why.</p>", "<p>Only one Republican state organization, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, had received any cash through August, according to FEC records. The amount was $1,050, to reimburse the party for tables and chairs.</p>", "<p>In an interview, McCutcheon said he did not mind that his lawsuit was paying more dividends for Democrats this year.</p>", "<p>\u201cI think a lot of those Democrats were just publicly saying it was a bad idea, but a lot of them were on board,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what party wins or loses as long as it\u2019s a free-speech system.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Thanks, GOP: Legal dodge of contribution limits fills Clinton coffers      "]}

You know that Clinton\u2019s presidency is the best option, you just want to pretend that something else is possible when it is not. You and me and about 220 million other people eligible to vote are tasked with the enormous responsibility of keeping the United States from electing a racist xenophobe. </p>", "<p>You shouldn\u2019t be proud of yourself for refusing to vote for Hillary, writing in Bernie Sanders or Jill Stein or that other guy who has no chance of winning. There is a very real threat that Trump becomes the president. And if you do not vote, or you vote for a third-party candidate, you are complicit in that result. Remember, this is exactly what happened in 2000 when 2.8 million people voted for the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, resulting in George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. </p>", "<p>You don\u2019t get to elect Obama, who played this same game, and then lose all faith in Clinton for doing the same thing. You don\u2019t get to claim foul play when the system for earning delegates has been the same all along. You don\u2019t get to stop playing the game because you just found out about the rules. If you\u2019re mad about the way Hillary Clinton secured the nomination, get involved to fix that system. </p>", "<p>There are going to be no pats on the back for you for standing by and watching the United States as we know it burn to the ground. The choice is simple for every voter: progress or regress. </p>", "<p>Hillary Clinton is a step forward. And while Bernie would have wanted two steps forward, the Donald would take us back by a mile.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Hillary Clinton, an experienced candidate and all-around \u2018badass\u2019      "]}

And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cGrab them by the p\u2014-. You can do anything.\u201d</p>", "<p>Asked whether he had ever sexually assaulted a woman, he said: \u201cNo, I have not.\u201d</p>", "<p>Trump\u2019s first wife, Ivana Trump, accused him of rape in a deposition in the early 1990s. She later said she didn\u2019t mean it literally, but rather that she felt violated. Trump was also sued for sexual harassment in 1997 by Jill Harth, a woman who, along with her romantic partner, was pitching Trump to get involved in a pin-up competition in the early 1990s.</p>", "<p>In a recent interview with The New York Times, Harth said Trump ran his hands up her skirt during dinner in 1992, and on another occasion, she said Trump tried to force himself on her in his daughter Ivanka\u2019s bedroom.</p>", "<p>DONALD TRUMP: Described the consequences of a sexual harassment lawsuit against former President Bill Clinton: \u201cHe lost his license. He had to pay an $850,000 fine.\u201d</p>", "<p>In 1998, lawyers for Bill Clinton settled with former Arkansas state employee Paul Jones for $850,000 in her four-year lawsuit alleging sexual harassment. Clinton did not acknowledge wrongdoing in the settlement. But Trump erred in describing the legal consequences of that case. In a related case before the Arkansas State Supreme Court, Clinton was fined $25,000 and his Arkansas law license was suspended for five years. Clinton also faced disbarment before the U.S. Supreme Court, but he opted to resign from the court\u2019s practice instead of facing any penalties.</p>", "<p>Trump said \u201cHillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.\u201d</p>", "<p>There is no clear, independent evidence that Hillary Clinton \u201cviciously\u201d attacked women who alleged or confirmed sexual contact with her husband.</p>", "<p>In the 1992 Democratic primaries, she was deeply involved in the Clinton campaign\u2019s effort to discredit one accuser, actress Gennifer Flowers, who alleged she had a long-running affair with Bill Clinton, who later acknowledged in a 1998 court deposition that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.</p>", "<p>Diane Blair, a political science professor and long-time Hillary Clinton friend who died in 2000, left behind an account of private interviews with Hillary Clinton in which she told her during the Monica Lewinsky affair that she considered the former White House intern a \u201cnarcissistic loony toon.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"break-category\">DONALD TRUMP: When Hillary Clinton defended an accused child-rapist in court, she \u201cgot him off, and she\u2019s seen on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.\u201d</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: Trump\u2019s depiction of Clinton laughing at a child rape victim is false, and his statement that she got the man off the hook isn\u2019t quite right.</p>", "<p>Clinton defended the man in 1975 at the demand of the judge in the case.</p>", "<p>According to both Clinton in a recorded interview and later statements by the prosecutor who handled the case, Clinton asked not to be assigned to defend the attacker of Kathy Shelton, but ultimately Clinton agreed to defend the man at the judge\u2019s insistence.</p>", "<p>According to audio of an interview Clinton gave to a reporter one decade later, Clinton suggested she believed her client, Thomas Alfred Taylor, was guilty, saying that his successful questioning under a polygraph test \u201cforever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.\u201d</p>", "<p>Despite her discomfort with the case, Clinton aggressively defended her client. In an affidavit to the court, she said a child psychologist had told her that children \u201cfrom disorganized families,\u201d such as the victim, \u201ctend to exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences.\u201d</p>", "<p>The crime lab in the case lost a swatch of the victim\u2019s underwear that the prosecution had said contained Taylor\u2019s semen and the victim\u2019s blood. Clinton seized on the mistake, arguing that the absence of evidence fatally undermined the prosecution\u2019s case \u2014 prompting the prosecutor to offer Clinton\u2019s client a plea deal to a lesser charge</p>", "<p>.In the recorded interview, Clinton never laughed at Shelton, calling it a \u201cterrible\u201d case and saying it was sad that prosecutors had lost the evidence against her client. But she did laugh at procedural errors in the case.</p>", "<p>DONALD TRUMP: Your (Obamacare) health insurance is going up \u2026 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent.</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: Premiums are expected to increase overall in 2017,\u00a0but Trump is cherry-picking from the highest proposed increases in the insurance marketplace.</p>", "<p>State-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma. But\u00a0the most common plans in the marketplace will see an average increase of 9 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/analysis-of-2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"content-link external\">July analysis</a>.\u00a0These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies.</p>", "<p>The vast majority of marketplace enrollees (about eight in 10) receive government premium subsidies. They are\u00a0protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan.</p>", "<p>CLINTON: \u201cIf we repeal (Obama\u2019s health care law) as Donald has proposed, all of those benefits I have mentioned are lost to everybody\u2026and then we will have to start all over again.\u201d</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: Clinton is essentially correct. Congressional Republicans have promised their replacement plan for Obama\u2019s health care law would provide coverage for the uninsured, but they have not provided enough detail to allow a rigorous comparison. A complete repeal of the health care law would wipe the slate clean and lawmakers would have to start over.</p>", "<p>Republicans have expressed support for some goals of the health care law, such as assuring that people with health problems can get coverage, but whether a GOP replacement plan would work as well remains to be seen. Trump\u2019s own plan was recently evaluated by the Commonwealth Fund and the RAND Corporation, and the analysis found it would increase the number of uninsured people by about 20 million.</p>", "<p>TRUMP: \u201cShe (Clinton) wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster\u2026she wants to go to single-payer, which means the government basically rules everything.\u201d</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: It\u2019s Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 not Clinton \u2014 who supports a Canada-style government-run health care system.</p>", "<p>While Clinton\u2019s health care proposals would expand the government\u2019s role in the health care system, she\u2019s not talking about dismantling the current system, which is a hybrid of employer-sponsored coverage, government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and individually purchased insurance.</p>", "<p>As president, Clinton would push for a government-sponsored insurance plan in the health care markets created by President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, as an alternative to private insurance. But those markets currently cover about 11 million people, while about 155 million have job-based coverage.</p>", "<p>TRUMP: \u201cShe is raising your taxes and I am lowering your taxes. \u2026 She\u2019s raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\u201d</p>", "<p>CLINTON: \u201cHe would end up raising taxes on middle-class families.\u201d</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: Clinton is not raising taxes on \u201ceverybody.\u201d Nearly all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposed tax increases would affect the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.</p>", "<p>Trump is proposing massive tax cuts for both individuals and businesses. Yet it\u2019s not clear that all Americans would benefit. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax income rise from 0.8 percent to 1.9 percent. The wealthiest 1 percent would see their after-tax incomes rise at least 10.2 percent to 16 percent.</p>", "<p>Yet Clinton may be right that Trump\u2019s proposals would increase taxes on many middle- and lower-income families. Trump\u2019s plan eliminates the personal exemption, which currently allows households to reduce their taxable income by $4,050 for each member of the household, including children. He would replace that with higher deductions, but for many single parents and families with three or more children, the standard deduction wouldn\u2019t be large enough to offset the loss of personal exemptions.</p>", "<p>DONALD TRUMP: \u201cI would not have had our troops in Iraq.\u201d</p>", "<p>Trump has repeatedly said in the campaign he opposed the Iraq War before it started. But the facts are clear: He did not.</p>", "<p>There is no evidence Trump expressed public opposition to the war before the U.S. invaded. Rather, he offered lukewarm support. The billionaire businessman only began to voice doubts about the conflict well after it began in March 2003.</p>", "<p>Trump\u2019s first known public comment on the topic came on Sept. 11, 2002, when he was asked whether he supported a potential Iraq invasion in an interview with radio host Howard Stern. \u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Trump responded. During a Fox News Channel interview with Neil Cavuto in January 2003, Trump suggested the economy and threats from North Korea posed greater problems for then-President George W. Bush than Iraq, but he did not say he opposed a possible invasion.</p>", "<p>On March 21, 2003, just days after the invasion began, Trump told Cavuto on his show that the invasion \u201clooks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\u201d</p>", "<p>Trump bolsters his position by pointing to an interview he did with Esquire. He was quoted as saying he opposed the war, saying he \u201cwould never have handled it that way.\u201d He made that comment, however, 16 months after the invasion began.</p>", "<p>DONALD TRUMP: \u201cWith all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.\u201d</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: This is wrong. The Obama administration has admitted 12,500 refugees over the past fiscal year, which slightly exceeded a goal of 10,000. Even so, this is about one-third accepted by Canada, with a much smaller population.</p>", "<p>Trump in the past has claimed that Clinton wants to admit 620,000 refugees in her first term. Clinton has supported accepting up to 65,000 refugees from Syria in one year. This is 55,000 more than the Obama administration\u2019s plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year.</p>", "<p>DONALD TRUMP: \u201cThere is a thing called clean coal.\u201d</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: Coal is not clean. When burned in power plants, it emits sulfur dioxides, nitrous oxides and mercury unless coal-fired power plants have scrubbers to remove those from the air, thanks to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency that Trump was \u201cso restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.\u201d</p>", "<p>Coal also emits carbon dioxide, which the Supreme Court in 2007 said was a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That carbon dioxide can only be removed from emissions at great cost and it is not currently in use except in areas where it can be used for enhanced oil recovery.</p>", "<p>Finally, the act of mining coal is not clean. It either involves open pit mines or underground mines that often pollute waters. And coal-fired power plants also produce coal ash waste that is often kept in ponds that are prone to leaking.</p>", "<p>HILLARY CLINTON: \u201cWe are now, for the first time ever, energy independent.\u201d</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: Clinton inaccurately overstates the case. For the first time in decades the United States gets more energy domestically than it imports, but it is not yet energy independent as the country continues to rely on oil imports, from the Mideast and elsewhere. Estimates vary as to when the U.S. might achieve energy independence.</p>", "<p>Domestic oil production has greatly increased in recent years. And at the same time oil imports as a percentage of consumption have dropped, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil imports have dropped from 3.58 billion barrels in 2008 to 2.68 billion barrels in 2015.</p>", "<p>DONALD TRUMP: \u201cI don\u2019t like Assad at all. But Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS.\u201d</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: Not true. Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad considers the Islamic State group to be among numerous \u201cterrorist\u201d groups that threaten his government, but his military is not fighting them. It is focused on combatting Syrian opposition groups, some of which are supported by the United States. The fight against the Islamic State militants is being waged by a U.S.-led coalition, with help from Turkey, by training, advising and equipping Syrian Arab and Kurdish fighters. While Moscow asserts that it is fighting the Islamic State extremists in Syria, the vast majority of its airstrikes have targeted opposition groups threatening the Assad government.</p>", "<p>HILLARY CLINTON: \u201cAfter a yearlong investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using, and there is no evidence that anyone can point to, at all \u2026 that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.\u201d</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: While there\u2019s indeed no direct, explicit evidence that classified information was leaked or that her server was breached, it was nevertheless connected to the internet in ways that made it more vulnerable to hackers \u2014 and the public may never know who saw them.</p>", "<p>The Associated Press previously discovered that her private server, which has been a major campaign issue for Clinton and the focus of U.S. investigations, appeared to allow users to connect to it openly over the internet and control it remotely. That practice, experts said, wasn\u2019t intended to be used without additional protective measures, and was the subject of U.S. government warnings at the time over attacks from even amateur hackers.</p>", "<p>Since the AP in early 2013 traced her server to her home in Chappaqua, New York, Clinton hasn\u2019t fully explained who administered her server, if it received software updates to plug security holes or if it was monitored for unauthorized access. It\u2019s also unclear what, if any, encryption software Clinton\u2019s server may have used to communicate with official U.S. government email accounts.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, FBI Director James Comey has said Clinton and her staff \u201cwere extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d But he said the FBI won\u2019t recommend criminal charges against Clinton for use of the server while she was secretary of state and closed the investigation.</p>", "<p>TRUMP, asked whether his tweets directing people to check out a sex tape showed discipline: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t, \u2018Check out a sex tape.\u2019\u201d</p>", "<p>THE FACTS: Yes it was. Trump tweeted \u201ccheck out sex tape and past\u201d of former 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado, a woman whom Clinton discussed in the first presidential debate as an example of Trump\u2019s derogatory comments about women.</p>", "<p>Machado has publicly supported Clinton and criticized Trump for body-shaming her by calling her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and threatening to take away her crown for gaining weight.</p>", "<p>The video Trump appeared to be referring to was from a Spanish reality show. In 2005, Machado, who was a contestant on the show, was filmed in bed, under the covers with a male contestant and speaking sexually about his body parts. The grainy footage doesn\u2019t show nudity, though Machado has said that she was having sex in the footage.</p>", "<p><em>Material from The Washington Post is included in this report.</em></p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      Fact-checking the 2nd Clinton-Trump debate      "]}

She absolutely needs to salute that flag.</p>", "<p>The dinner, we know, is mostly a joke fest. Every four years, with some exceptions, the two principal presidential candidates show up in formal dress. Each has self-deprecating humorous moments, slinging just a few funny lines at the other side, and everyone is happy. The Catholic Church, sponsoring the affair, gets lots of money to help needy children, and people leave with good feelings.</p>", "<p>This year was different. Donald Trump told some great jokes on himself and Clinton \u2014 and then seriously hit Clinton, rightly earning boos. Clinton then did much the same, going after him with some pretty tough zingers, getting a few boos, too, and then, at the end getting preachy in a semi-disguised diatribe.</p>", "<p>It may have sounded to some like a general statement of ideals, but it was clearly meant to smear Trump as she discussed those who appeal to \u201cfear and division\u201d in contrast to the godly command of loving one\u2019s neighbors.</p>", "<p>To underline Trump\u2019s position on immigration, she talked about Catholics as the descendants of immigrants who had to fight their way up. She pointed to all the prejudice Catholics have faced as a way of knocking his once calling for a ban on Muslims coming here. She talked about a need \u201cto build bridges, not walls,\u201d as a not-so-hidden reference to you know what. She cited Pope Francis as warning against a \u201cmindset of hostility,\u201d meaning Trump\u2019s hostility, of course.</p>", "<p>So here is question one: Is it civil, reflecting a mindset of love, to spend a fortune on TV ads depicting Trump as a woman-hater, a vulgar and rotten human scarring children with his talk, a Ku Klux Klan sympathizer and falsely as someone who would nuke our allies in Western Europe? That\u2019s just for starters, because there are scads of other such ads, plus Cher calling Trump Hitler at a Clinton rally.</p>", "<p>Well, you say, he deserves it. But isn\u2019t that a way of saying two wrongs make a right, and what about the millions of his followers Clinton described as racists, sexists, xenophobes, homophobes and otherwise deplorable? Is that what she thinks of as building bridges? Is that her idea of how to end division?</p>", "<p>In the discussion about police shooting blacks, Clinton has also said that cops are racist, at least \u201cimplicitly,\u201d which merely means their actions show as much. That\u2019s no way to bring people together, and, when pushed on it, she said, well, the whole country is racist. In other words, it is not just the cops and half of Trump\u2019s supporters, but all of us, apparently including Hillary herself.</p>", "<p>Clinton\u2019s campaign honchos have also discussed Catholicism in a dismissive way, leading one archbishop, first describing her as \u201ca scheming, robotic liar,\u201d to add that she has an \u201centourage riddled with anti-Catholic bigots.\u201d He was not warmhearted about Trump, either, it should be said.</p>", "<p>Trump did once say a protester should be punched in the face. Some of Clinton\u2019s supporters, including Vice President Joe Biden, have talked about punching him. It bears repeating by me and others that, as secretary of state, Clinton once said that a drone should be used to take out Julian Assange.</p>", "<p>Our Democratic candidate, who is almost sure to win the election, is also known as being rude to the point of slinging curse words at Secret Service agents and others trying to serve her.

That does not justify electing an unqualified candidate whose policies and behavior contradict the values of most Washingtonians and Americans, Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals.</p>", "<p>For voters on the fence who dislike Clinton and are wary of Trump, this election is like the game of \u201cwould you rather\u201d \u2014 would you rather eat a slug or a tarantula?</p>", "<p>The ballot asks undecided voters if they would rather elect an unpalatable insider or an egotistical boor out of his depth and fond of authoritarians.</p>", "<p>America would benefit from a president with Clinton\u2019s experience in state, federal and international affairs.</p>", "<p>Clinton brings a superior understanding of America\u2019s challenges, opportunities and its role in building prosperity and stability around the world. Trump\u2019s naive threats to erect trade barriers and re-evaluate cornerstone defense alliances in Europe and Asia are already rattling allies and trading partners.</p>", "<p>Risks are greater at home. All Americans are created equal and entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Current and future Americans are free to worship as they choose. This alone is reason to vote against Trump, who has suggested the government shut down houses of worship (mosques) and register people of a particular faith \u2014 Islam.</p>", "<p>America is a nation of immigrants and a welcoming land of opportunity. This increases the nation\u2019s strength and stature. Yet our immigration system desperately needs reform. Instead of solutions that acknowledge the problem\u2019s complexity and the positive contributions of immigrants, Trump offers unworkable, knee-jerk schemes like a border wall funded by Mexico.</p>", "<p>Trump has said the 14th Amendment\u2019s provision of citizenship to those born in the U.S. should be denied to children of immigrants without documents. That echoes his selective application of religious freedom. Those who treasure the Constitution should reject a candidate who would pick and choose who receives its protections.</p>", "<p>Clinton would continue President Obama\u2019s effort to prevent deportation of low-risk immigrants, such as those who arrived as children and have no felony convictions. Overall, she seeks to lower barriers for immigrants to become citizens.</p>", "<p>Trump\u2019s trade proposals are repellent, such as creating punishing tariffs on key trading partners China and Mexico. These tariffs would not restore yesteryear\u2019s manufacturing jobs, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/opinion/campaign-stops/global-trade-war-trump-edition.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"content-link external\">would wreak economic havoc</a> and cause job loss.</p>", "<p>Clinton <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/hoping-hillary-clinton-changes-her-mind-on-the-trans-pacific-partnership/\" class=\"content-link\">disappointingly has wavered on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership </a>during her campaign. But she acknowledges the importance of free trade. Economic diplomacy also is essential to prevent conflict with China and build alliances to address threats like North Korea.</p>", "<p>Trade and Asia\u2019s growing volatility are of particular concern in trade-dependent Washington. The state is also a strategic location, with <a href=\"http://www.commerce.wa.gov/growing-the-economy/key-sectors/military-defense/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"content-link external\">more than 112,000 </a>military and defense workers.</p>", "<p>Clinton\u2019s penchant for secrecy and defensiveness are concerns. They were highlighted by her poor response to disclosures that she mishandled sensitive emails while secretary of state.</p>", "<p>America needs a president committed to openness and comfortable with transparency, but there is no good choice on that front in 2016.</p>", "<p>Most voters will base their decision on character. Therein, the distinction is clear and leaves them with just one option.</p>", "<p>Clinton has demonstrated courage, strength and resilience \u2014 the traits we especially value in a president. She does this not by tweets and talking tough but through unflagging public service through personal and political crises that would crumble an ordinary person.</p>", "<p>Trump, in contrast, has never served the public and shows disrespect for most of the people he would lead and the institution he would manage. Under campaign pressure that pales to that of the presidency, he has responded to slights and setbacks with bluster and threats. That demonstrates insecurity, fragility and a shocking lack of inner strength and control.</p>", "<p>America will face many challenges at home and abroad over the next four years. Still, its overall success and world leadership will continue \u2014 if Trump is not elected.</p>", "<p>Clinton is the only choice for president. She is undeniably the candidate with the experience, skills, knowledge and self-control to do the job.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      The Times recommends: Hillary Clinton, the only choice for president      "]}

Elizabeth Warren.</p>", "<p>Among the issues included in the latest round of emails, allegedly purloined from John Podesta\u2019s account, are messages in which former President Clinton\u2019s personal aide, Doug Band, is quoted as disparaging Clinton\u2019s daughter Chelsea \u201cas a spoiled brat kid\u201d over disputes at the family\u2019s foundation. They also depict internal debate over how to handle Democrat Warren\u2019s proposal to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, barring commercial banks from underwriting corporate securities.</p>", "<p>\u201cI am still worried that we will antagonize and activate Elizabeth Warren by opposing a new Glass Steagall,\u201d and about \u201cElizabeth deciding to endorse Bernie\u201d (Sanders, Clinton\u2019s opponent in the Democratic primaries), Mandy Grunwald, Clinton communications adviser, allegedly wrote in October 2015. \u201cI worry about defending the banks in the debate.\u201d</p>", "<p>Grunwald went on to say that Clinton had been \u201ckind of leaning toward endorsing Glass Steagall\u201d but \u201cwe face phoniness charges if we \u2018change\u2019 our position now.\u201d Clinton hasn\u2019t endorsed reinstating the law, which was repealed in 1999 under President Bill Clinton. An aide to Warren declined to comment.</p>", "<p>The Clinton campaign has blamed the leaks of Democratic documents on Russia and refused to confirm the authenticity of the emails. Podesta last week seemed to suggest that the communications may have been altered.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt should concern every American that Russia is willing to engage in such hostile acts in order to help Donald Trump become President of the United States,\u201d the Clinton campaign said in a statement Monday. Trump, during Sunday\u2019s debate, repeated previous statements that Russia may not be responsible for the breaches even though U.S. intelligence agencies have said it was.</p>", "<p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking,\u201d Trump said of Clinton. \u201cMaybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia.\u201d</p>", "<p>Last week\u2019s email release from WikiLeaks purported to show messages from private paid speeches Clinton delivered in which she voiced support for \u201copen trade and open borders\u201d and discussed being \u201ckind of far removed\u201d from middle-class life.</p>", "<p>The latest emails appeared to reveal that, in late 2011, Podesta, who served as President Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, received complaints from both Chelsea Clinton and Band, who had held a leadership position at the Clinton Foundation but was increasingly shifting his attention to an international consultancy he founded.</p>", "<p>At a time when she was taking an increased role at the foundation, Chelsea complained about a news story linking her father to collapsed brokerage firm MF Global through Band\u2019s firm, Teneo Holdings LLC, and suggested Teneo was blurring the lines between Bill Clinton\u2019s work and its own clients without the former president\u2019s knowledge.</p>", "<p>Two people she said she spoke to in London \u201cvoiced serious concerns,\u201d she wrote on Dec. 6, 2011, including alleging that a former Bill Clinton staffer had \u201ccalled Members of the House and Members of Parliament, \u2018on behalf of President Clinton,\u2019\u2009\u201d for Teneo clients.</p>", "<p>Band had written a month earlier that his business had \u201calmost nothing to do with the clintons, the foundation or cgi in any way,\u201d referring to the Clinton Global Initiative, an affiliate of the Clinton Foundation.</p>", "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect or at least a direct dialogue for me to explain these things,\u201d Band continued. \u201cShe is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n          By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n        </p>", "<p>\n          The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.\n          </p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.</p>", "<p class=\"sub-label\">\n            By signing up you are agreeing to our <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"http://company.seattletimes.com/notices/notice1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.\n          </p>"], "title": ["\n      WikiLeaks posts more emails reportedly from Clinton camp      "]}
